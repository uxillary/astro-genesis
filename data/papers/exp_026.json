    "abstract": "Outer space is an extremely hostile environment for human life, with ionizing radiation from galactic cosmic rays and microgravity posing the most significant hazards to the health of astronauts. Spaceflight has also been shown to have an impact on established cancer hallmarks, possibly increasing carcinogenic risk. Terrestrially, women have a higher incidence of radiation-induced cancers, largely driven by lung, thyroid, breast, and ovarian cancers, and therefore, historically, they have been permitted to spend significantly less time in space than men. In the present review, we focus on the effects of microgravity and radiation on the female reproductive system, particularly gynecological cancer. The aim is to provide a summary of the research that has been carried out related to the risk of gynecological cancer, highlighting what further studies are needed to pave the way for safer exploration class missions, as well as postflight screening and management of women astronauts following long-duration spaceflight.

    "conclusion": "The current data reveal a scarcity of knowledge about the impact of space radiation and microgravity on gynecologic cancer, as there have been insufficient numbers of female astronauts exposed to long-duration, low-dose rate, and proton and heavy ion radiation to reliably determine the impact on the female reproductive system. With the upcoming Artemis missions set to place the first females on the Moon, there will be longer duration of exposures to both microgravity and space radiation; hence, the influence of flight length on risks related to gynecological cancers will demand a larger focus in ensuring astronaut safety during flight and postflight. Indeed, among all body tissues, the male and female gonads are among the most sensitive to radiation. Therefore, these tissues may be one of the best to study to determine space radiation related exposures."

  "ai_summary": "This review examines the potential risks of gynecological cancers in female astronauts due to the unique challenges of spaceflight, particularly microgravity and ionizing radiation from galactic cosmic rays. Historically, women have had limited opportunities for long-duration space missions due to their higher susceptibility to radiation-induced cancers, including breast and ovarian cancers. The authors highlight a significant gap in research regarding the effects of space conditions on the female reproductive system, noting that current data is insufficient to assess the risks accurately. As upcoming Artemis missions aim to send women to the Moon for extended periods, it is crucial to understand how prolonged exposure to microgravity and radiation may influence gynecological cancer risks. The findings underscore the need for targeted studies to ensure the safety and health of female astronauts, particularly in light of their heightened vulnerability to radiation. This research is vital for developing effective screening and management strategies for women in space exploration."
