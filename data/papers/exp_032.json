    "conclusion": "We are entering an exciting new era of space exploration previously only thought of as science fiction. Commercial/private and civilian spaceflights, such as Inspiration4 and the Polaris missions are no longer just a possibility but a reality. Exciting as these opportunities are, they also come with the burden of ensuring that future space travel will be as safe and ethical as possible. While governmental oversight has historically governed space activities, the emergence of non-governmental initiatives calls for unified ethical guidelines, safeguarding human well-being during selection, research, and decision-making in space. Since non-governmental outfits are not bound by the same rules in the same way, we as a community must ensure that the guidelines we set will guide space exploration according to the highest ethical and medical standards for humans that are currently possible, including selection of SOs, medical research ranging from human subject research to discussion of in-flight triage decisions. The added difficulties of non-universal terminology referring to different kinds of space travelers and of making guidelines sensitive to the diversity and variety of potential spaceflight endeavors will add further layers of complexity. The earlier and better any such guidelines can be implemented, the better the chances that space travel can be performed according to the safest and most optimal standards."

  "ai_summary": "As non-governmental space exploration gains momentum, ethical considerations surrounding the selection of space travelers and the conduct of human subject research have become increasingly critical. This study highlights the pressing need for unified ethical guidelines to ensure the safety and well-being of a diverse array of space travelers participating in commercial and private missions. With initiatives like Inspiration4 and the Polaris missions transitioning from concept to reality, the absence of stringent governmental oversight raises concerns about ethical standards in medical research and decision-making in space. The authors emphasize the importance of establishing robust protocols that address the unique challenges posed by non-governmental operations, including the selection process for space travelers and the complexities of conducting medical research in such an environment. By advocating for comprehensive ethical frameworks, this research aims to safeguard human health and uphold the highest medical standards in the evolving landscape of space exploration, ensuring that future missions prioritize ethical integrity alongside scientific advancement."
