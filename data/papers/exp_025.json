    "abstract": "Background Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has a detrimental impact on human health on Earth and it is equally concerning in other environments such as space habitat due to microgravity, radiation and confinement, especially for long-distance space travel. The International Space Station (ISS) is ideal for investigating microbial diversity and virulence associated with spaceflight. The shotgun metagenomics data of the ISS generated during the Microbial Tracking–1 (MT-1) project and resulting metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) across three flights in eight different locations during 12 months were used in this study. The objective of this study was to identify the AMR genes associated with whole genomes of 226 cultivable strains, 21 shotgun metagenome sequences, and 24 MAGs retrieved from the ISS environmental samples that were treated with propidium monoazide (PMA; viable microbes). Results We have analyzed the data using a deep learning model, allowing us to go beyond traditional cut-offs based only on high DNA sequence similarity and extending the catalog of AMR genes. Our results in PMA treated samples revealed AMR dominance in the last flight for Kalamiella piersonii , a bacteria related to urinary tract infection in humans. The analysis of 226 pure strains isolated from the MT-1 project revealed hundreds of antibiotic resistance genes from many isolates, including two top-ranking species that corresponded to strains of Enterobacter bugandensis and Bacillus cereus . Computational predictions were experimentally validated by antibiotic resistance profiles in these two species, showing a high degree of concordance. Specifically, disc assay data confirmed the high resistance of these two pathogens to various beta-lactam antibiotics. Conclusion Overall, our computational predictions and validation analyses demonstrate the advantages of machine learning to uncover concealed AMR determinants in metagenomics datasets, expanding the understanding of the ISS environmental microbiomes and their pathogenic potential in humans.

    "methods": "Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs) methodology The paired-end 100-bp metagenomic reads from NCBI Short Read Archive (SRA) under the bio-project number PRJNA438545 were processed with Trimmomatic [ 12 ] to trim adapter sequences and low-quality ends, with a minimum Phred score of 20 across the entire length of the read used as a quality cut-off. Reads shorter than 80 bp were removed after trimming. Remaining high-quality reads were subsequently assembled using metaSPAdes [ 37 ]. Contigs were binned using Metabat2 v2.11.3 [ 31 ]. Recovered genomes were evaluated with CheckM [ 39 ], and a recovered genome was considered good with at least 90% completeness and at most 10% contamination. Each genome was subsequently annotated with the help of Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology (RAST), and near identifications were predicted [ 6 ]. Sample collection for Microbial Tracking 1 mission During the microbial tracking investigation to characterize airborne and surface-associated microbial population aboard the International Space Station, samples were collected from ISS locations, and ground samples were collected from the Crew resupply vehicle. A sterile polyester wipe premoistened with Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was used to collect the samples from various areas across these ISS locations, and the details and description of the sample collection and cultivation have already been reported in Checinska Sielaff et al. [ 14 ] and Singh et al. [ 43 ]. Pure isolates were selected and sub-cultured, and the sub-cultures were sequenced. Isolates from Microbial Tracking 1 mission To create the whole-genome sequences (WGS) of these strains, shotgun libraries were prepared using the Illumina Nextera Flex protocol [ 44 ], using NovaSeq 6000 S4 flow cell 2150 paired-end (PE) sequencing. Verification of the quality of the raw sequencing data was carried out using FastQC v0.11.7 [ 2 ]. Quality control for adapter trimming and quality filtering were performed using fastp v0.20.0 [ 15 ], and then SPAdes v3.11.1 [ 7 ] was used to assemble all the cleaned sequences. Fastp quality control was based on the following three parameters: (i) correction of mismatches in overlapped regions of paired-end reads, (ii) trimming of autodetected adapter sequences, and (iii) quality trimming at the 59 and 39 ends. To determine the quality of the assembled sequences, the number of contigs, the N50 value, and the total length were calculated using QUAST v5.0.2 [ 26 ]. Default parameters were used for all software. The average nucleotide identity (ANI) [ 59 ] was calculated using OrthoANIu by comparing each of the scaffolds to the WGS of the respective type strains. Identification of ORFs in microbial DNA sequences Glimmer (Gene Locator and Interpolated Markov ModelER) v3.02 was used with default parameters to identify the coding regions and distinguish them from non-coding DNA in MAGs and MT-1 scaffolds that could be used as an input in DeepARG-LS. Minimum gene length was indicated as 50 bp (‘glimmer3 -g50’). Glimmer reads DNA sequences in a FASTA file format and predicts genes in them using an Interpolated Context Model [ 21 ]. Prediction of antibiotic resistance genes in short reads and full-gene length sequences DeepARG version 2 [ 3 ], a deep learning-based approach for predicting ARGs and annotation, was run with the ‘--reads’ option (DeepARG-SS) for NGS reads and the ‘--genes’ option (DeepRG-LS) for longer gene-like sequences obtained with Glimmer. The DeepARG model consists of four dense hidden layers of 2000, 1000, 500, and 100 units that propagate a bit score distribution. The output layer of the deep neural network consists of 30 units that correspond to the antibiotic resistance categories (102 antibiotics consolidated into 30 antibiotic categories). The model was trained with a curated database of 14,933 genes from three databases (CARD, ARDB, and UNIPROT) [ 3 ]. Default options were used: 50% minimum percentage of identity to consider, significance of the prediction probability cut-off of 0.8 as recommended [ 3 ], and E-value of alignments (default 1e−10). The software was downloaded from https://bitbucket.org/gusphdproj/deeparg-ss . Microbial nucleotide BLAST Nucleotide-Nucleotide BLAST 2.10.1+ ( https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi ) was used to identify microbial species associated to MT-1 scaffolds. Sequences producing significant alignments were ranked and the species associated to maximum Score (bits) and minimum E value was deemed as the closest match. Gene annotations and pan-genome analysis of MT-1 scaffolds A Docker image with the software tool Prokka v1.14.5 [ 42 ] was pulled and used with default parameters to annotate bacterial isolates. The master annotations in GFF3 format for the 226 isolates have been deposited at the Zenodo platform [DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.6518836]. Using the annotated assemblies in GFF3 format for E. bugandensis and B. cereus strains, Roary v3.13.0 was run with default parameters to compare isolates based on genes and the number of isolates they are present in. Phenotypic antibiotic resistance testing Disc assays experiments were performed and reported in Urbaniak et al. [ 51 ]. The isolates were streaked from glycerol stocks onto R2A plates. A single colony was inoculated into 5 mL Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) and grown overnight at 30°C. Aliquots of 100 μL were plated on TSA. Agar diffusion discs (BD BBLTM Sensi-DiscTM, Franklin Lakes, NJ) were placed aseptically on a plate and the strains were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The tested antibiotics included: 30-μg cefazolin (CZ-30); 30-μg cefoxitin (FOX-30), 5 μg ciprofloxacin (CIP-5), 15 μg erythromycin (E-15), 10-μg gentamicin (GM-10), 1-μg oxacillin (OX), 10-μg penicillin (P-10), 5-μg rifampin (RA-5), and 10 μg tobramycin (NN-10). The diameter of inhibition zones was measured for each antibiotic disk and recorded in millimeters. The resistance results were compared with the zone diameter interpretive charts provided by the manufacturer. When the spontaneous mutants were present in response to some antibiotics, they were isolated, subcultured and tested for the specific antibiotic resistance. Data availability Raw metagenomics reads from three flights on multiple locations were downloaded from NASA GeneLab repository https://genelab.nasa.gov (GLDS-69). The ISS MAGs datasets are available at the SRA database under the accession number: PRJNA438545 [ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA438545/ ]. Microbial tracking-1 (MT-1) datasets (raw sequencing data and sequence assembly files) were obtained from GLDS-67, GLDS-302, GLDS-303, GLDS-309, GLDS-311 and GLDS-350. The rest of the samples are deposited at DDBJ/ ENA/GenBank or are unpublished.",

  "ai_summary": "This study investigates antimicrobial resistance (AMR) within the microbiome of the International Space Station (ISS), a critical concern for long-duration space missions. Utilizing shotgun metagenomics data from the Microbial Tracking–1 project, researchers analyzed samples from various ISS locations over 12 months, focusing on 226 cultivable strains and metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). By employing a deep learning model, the study identified a broader range of AMR genes than traditional methods, revealing a significant presence of AMR in the bacterium Kalamiella piersonii during the last flight. Notably, strains of Enterobacter bugandensis and Bacillus cereus exhibited high resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics, confirmed through experimental validation. These findings underscore the potential risks posed by AMR in space environments, emphasizing the need for ongoing monitoring and strategies to mitigate microbial threats during future space exploration. The research enhances our understanding of the ISS microbiome and its implications for human health in extraterrestrial settings."
