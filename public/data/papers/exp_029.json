    "abstract": "COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, has caused significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. The betacoronavirus continues to evolve with global health implications as we race to learn more to curb its transmission, evolution, and sequelae. The focus of this review, the second of a three-part series, is on the biological effects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on post-acute disease in the context of tissue and organ adaptations and damage. We highlight the current knowledge and describe how virological, animal, and clinical studies have shed light on the mechanisms driving the varied clinical diagnoses and observations of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, we describe how investigations into SARS-CoV-2 effects have informed the understanding of viral pathogenesis and provide innovative pathways for future research on the mechanisms of viral diseases.

    "conclusion": "SARS-CoV-2 and its resultant acute and chronic diseases, COVID-19 and PASC, have caused significant impacts worldwide. Here we describe and review the latest knowledge about the viral effect on our physiology, as well as the latest research on relevant whole-body metabolism pathways, circulating biological components (e.g., RNA, cytokine, hormones, etc.), and affected organ systems and their physiological adaptations consequent to SARS-CoV-2 infection. COVID-19 is a pleiotropic, complex, and dynamic condition (Fig. 4 ). The viral insults and cellular adaptations differ depending on the context, from cellular to organ systems, and intricate biochemistry ties and integrates these systems together. Herein, we have attempted to capture the prevalent host responses, as well as highlight gaps of knowledge that could be addressed with future research. We have also touched on relevant biochemical targets with potential for mitigating COVID-19 in the human host, and we will describe current and in-development treatment modalities that affect these in Part 3 of our review. Fig. 4. COVID-19 biological adaptations and effects. Open in a new tab The multi-faceted and multiplex physiological adaptations resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection, including the different cells, tissues, and organs that respond to viral infection. The airway milieu refers to the viral factors contained from inhalation and response to these factors in the lungs, while the systemic milieu refers to the viral factors transported through the circulation system and across body, and in turn, the physiological responses to these factors."

  "ai_summary": "This review explores the biological impacts of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, particularly focusing on post-acute sequelae and the resultant tissue and organ adaptations. As the virus continues to evolve, understanding its effects on human physiology is crucial for addressing the ongoing health crisis. The authors synthesize findings from virological, animal, and clinical studies to elucidate the mechanisms behind the diverse clinical manifestations observed in COVID-19 patients. Key findings reveal that SARS-CoV-2 leads to complex physiological changes that vary across different organ systems, highlighting the interplay between viral infection and host responses. The review emphasizes the need for further research to fill knowledge gaps and identifies potential biochemical targets for therapeutic intervention. By advancing our understanding of the virus's systemic effects, this work contributes to the broader field of space biosciences, where similar mechanisms may influence human health in extraterrestrial environments.",
