    "abstract": "Cytoplasmic calcium ([Ca 2+ ] cyt ) is a well-characterized second messenger in eukaryotic cells. An elevation in [Ca 2+ ] cyt levels is one of the earliest responses in plant cells after exposure to a range of environmental stimuli. Advances in understanding the role of [Ca 2+ ] cyt in plant development has been facilitated by the use of genetically-encoded reporters such as GCaMP. Most of these studies have relied on promoters such as Cauliflower Mosaic Virus ( 35S ) and Ubiquitin10 ( UBQ10 ) to drive expression of GCaMP in all cell/tissue types. Plant organs such as roots consist of various cell types that likely exhibit unique [Ca 2+ ] cyt responses to exogenous and endogenous signals. However, few studies have addressed this question. Here, we introduce a set of Arabidopsis thaliana lines expressing GCaMP3 in five root cell types including the columella, endodermis, cortex, epidermis, and trichoblasts. We found similarities and differences in the [Ca 2+ ] cyt signature among these root cell types when exposed to adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP), glutamate, aluminum, and salt, which are known to trigger [Ca 2+ ] cyt increases in root cells. These cell type-targeted GCaMP3 lines provide a new resource that should enable more in depth studies that address how a particular environmental stimulus is linked to specific root developmental pathways via [Ca 2+ ] cyt .

    "methods": "As shown in the preceding sections, the 0.5X MS control solution induced [Ca 2+ ] cyt changes in UBQ10:GCaMP3 and lines in which GCaMP3 was expressed in cells on the root surface and cortex ( Figure 3 , Figure 4 and Figure 5 ). Although the MS-induced [Ca 2+ ] cyt responses were clearly distinct from ATP, glutamate, and Al 3+ treatments, we were concerned that the growth conditions in which these first experiments were conducted made roots more sensitive to osmotic changes and/or mechanical perturbation due to the process of adding the solutions. We argued that MS-induced [Ca 2+ ] cyt transients could be dampened relative to the chemical applications by: (1) using freshly prepared MS plates for planting seeds and (2) pretreating roots two times with MS solution prior to application of the actual chemical solution. These modifications in our treatment protocols were tested using ATP which typically generated peaks with the highest amplitude. Compared to the datasets shown in Figure 3 , Figure 4 and Figure 5 , the [Ca 2+ ] cyt transients triggered by the MS solution were significantly dampened when fresh plates were used for the experiments ( Figure 7 ). The dampened MS-induced [Ca 2+ ] cyt transients were observed in the two sequential MS applications. Pretreatment with MS solution had the added benefit of allowing roots to adapt prior to ATP application (adapted ATP = ATP:MS). Under these modified growth and pretreatment conditions, the ATP-induced [Ca 2+ ] cyt increases were lower in amplitude when compared to the [Ca 2+ ] cyt increases shown in Figure 3 . Despite the lower ATP-induced [Ca 2+ ] cyt transients, these [Ca 2+ ] cyt responses were better separated from the [Ca 2+ ] cyt responses induced by MS solution, particularly in lines expressing UBQ10:GCaMP3 and those in which GCaMP3 was expressed in root surface cell types and the cortex ( Figure 7 ). In addition to the dampened response, [Ca 2+ ] cyt response to ATP:MS for UBQ10:GCaMP3 and PIN2:GCaMP3 lines had broader peaks than those shown in Figure 3 . For PRP3:GCaMP3 -expressing lines, the [Ca 2+ ] cyt response was markedly different from the initial ATP treatment ( Figure 3 C and Figure 7 C). Application of ATP after 0.5X MS adaptation caused a strong, monophasic response earlier than either UBQ10:GCaMP3 or PIN2:GCaMP3 lines. Lines expressing PEP:GCaMP3 showed a continued elevated [Ca 2+ ] cyt response that oscillated throughout the 10 min time course compared to either UBQ10:GCaMP3 lines or the previous ATP treatment ( Figure 3 D and Figure 7 D). For lines expressing SCR:GCaMP3 or ATHB8:GCaMP3 , the response was similar to previous ATP treatments, but without the strong transient peak ( Figure 3 E,F and Figure 7 E,F). After the cell-type specific lines were adapted to the 0.5× MS control solution, the response time for ATP:MS was initiated later than the previous ATP treatment ( Table 1 ). Figure 7.

To further tease out the differences among GCaMP3 -expressing lines, we obtained the time elapsed from chemical application to maximum GCaMP3 fluorescence (referred to as reaction time), and analyzed the relationship between chemicals using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with Tukey Post-Hoc test ( Table 1 ). Our analysis showed that reaction time was delayed in lines where GCaMP3 was expressed in inner cell types. When comparing the different chemical treatments, ATP, glutamate, and Al 3+ showed similar responses (except ATHB8:GCaMP3 to Al 3+ ) while adapted ATP:MS showed significantly slower reaction times to both ATP and glutamate ( Table 1 ). However, with such a small sample size, statistical significance may indicate a trend rather than actual significance. NaCl reaction time was not included due to the large variation in responses across each line.",
    "results": "2.1. Expression of GCaMP3 in Different Root Cell Types of A. thaliana To the best of our knowledge, plant lines expressing genetically encoded [Ca 2+ ] cyt sensors that are available to the scientific community are driven by constitutive promoters. A. thaliana lines expressing the UBQ10:GCaMP3 construct, which we generated and used previously to study [Ca 2+ ] cyt oscillations in root hairs [ 17 ], is one example. In addition to root hairs, GCaMP3 fluorescence was detected in all cell-types of the primary root of A. thaliana expressing the UBQ10:GCaMP3 construct ( Figure 1 ). Using confocal microscopy, strong fluorescence was observed in cells located at the root surface, such as the peripheral root cap and epidermis ( Figure 1 A,B,D). Moderate levels of fluorescence could also be detected in the underlying cortex ( Figure 1 C). However, in cells located deeper within the root, such as the columella and endodermis, fluorescence was obscured by the fluorescence from surface cells ( Figure 1 A,B). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Confocal imaging of primary roots of 5-day-old A. thaliana seedlings expressing UBQ10:GCaMP3 . Representative bright-field and corresponding single-optical section confocal images of the root tip with a focus on the root cap ( A ), meristem ( B ), and elongation zone ( C , D ). c = columella; end = endodermis; epi = epidermis; cor = cortex. Scale bar: 50 μm. This prompted us to generate a set of constructs that drive GCaMP3 expression in specific root cell types. For this purpose, we used promoters described in the SWELL promoter collection including ATHB8 (columella), SCARECROW ( SCR , endodermis), Pin-Formed 2 (PIN2 , epidermis and cortex), PEP (cortex), and Proline rich protein 3(PRP3 , trichoblasts) [ 16 ]. For the five constructs, we found that GCaMP3 signal was most prominent in the expected cell types ( Figure 2 ). For example, ATHB8 and SCR promoters drove strong GCaMP3 expression in the columella and endodermis, respectively ( Figure 2 A,B). For ATHB8:GCaMP3 -expressing lines, we also observed weak fluorescence in the peripheral cap cells and the stele. For SCR:GCaMP3 , fluorescence in the endodermis was observed in all root developmental zones from the meristem and elongation zone, continuing into the maturation zone. Roots of PEP:GCaMP3 - and PRP3:GCaMP3 -expressing seedlings also showed fluorescence in the expected cell types (i.e., cortex and trichoblast, respectively) ( Figure 2 C,D). On the other hand, fluorescence was detected in the epidermis and cortex of PIN2:GCaMP3 -expressing lines, consistent with observations of Marques-Bueno et al. (2016) [ 16 ] ( Figure 2 E). Figure 2.

ATHB8:GCaMP3 is expressed in the columella with some fluorescence visible in the stele. SCR:GCaMP3 is expressed in the endodermis and PEP:GCaMP3 is expressed in the cortex.

The small box on the upper right corner of panel E shows a computer reconstructed cross-section of the primary root of a PIN2:GCaMP3 -expressing line. The image was generated from 50 optical sections taken at 0.50 μm intervals. Note that GCaMP3 is predominantly expressed in the epidermis and cortex. c = columella; ste = stele; epi = epidermis; cor = cortex; end = endodermis; t = trichoblast; a = atrichoblasts. Scale bar: 50 μm. 2.2. Chemical Treatments of Cell-Type Specific GCaMP3 Constructs Studies on Ca 2+ signaling in plants over several years have revealed various stimuli that can trigger a rapid elevation in [Ca 2+ ] cyt including cold, touch, wounding, hormones, reactive oxygen species, cyclic nucleotides, amino acids and nutrient/ionic stress [ 5 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 ]. We used some of these known [Ca 2+ ] cyt triggers to test the responsiveness of our root cell-specific GCaMP3 lines. We first analyzed the response of the GCaMP3 lines to adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP) ( Figure 3 ). In mammalian systems, ATP is a neurotransmitter that is perceived by plasma membrane bound purinergic receptors, and its signaling role is facilitated through increases in [Ca 2+ ] cyt [ 24 ]. While plants do not have the canonical purinergic receptors found in mammals, they perceive ATP via lectin receptor-like kinases and, similar to mammals, ATP elicits a rapid increase in [Ca 2+ ] cyt [ 25 , 26 , 27 ]. Comparable to previous reports, application of ATP to the elongation zone of roots expressing UBQ10:GCaMP3 elicited a rapid rise in [Ca 2+ ] cyt -dependent fluorescence followed by a gradual decline ( Figure 3 A) [ 5 , 25 ]. To determine if the increase in [Ca 2+ ] cyt was due exclusively to ATP, we applied the solvent control solution, which consisted of 0.5× Murashige Skoog (MS) solution without ATP to roots. We found that applying MS solution triggered a rise in [Ca 2+ ] cyt that was delayed and lower in amplitude compared to the [Ca 2+ ] cyt change caused by ATP ( Figure 3 A). This observation suggests that under our growing conditions, adding a drop of solvent control solution to the root can induce an increase in [Ca 2+ ] cyt , which could be the result of a touch or hypoosmotic response [ 19 , 20 , 27 , 28 ]. Therefore, in testing the cell-type GCaMP3 lines, we included solvent control applications in all of the experiments so we could tease apart [Ca 2+ ] cyt changes due to the desired stimulus from those resulting from a touch or hypoosmotic response. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Time course of [Ca 2+ ] cyt changes in A. thaliana roots after 1 mM ATP application. The leftmost panel shows an inverted fluorescence image of the terminal 300 μm of an A. thaliana primary root to illustrate different cells in which GCaMP3 was expressed.

( A – F ) Quantification of [Ca 2+ ] cyt -dependent fluorescence of various lines expressing GCaMP3 after ATP and solvent control (0.5× MS) application. Black arrows indicate the time of treatment. Plotted values represent the average normalized fluorescence intensity from 3–6 regions of interest (ROI) per line with standard error bars every fifth time point. Fluorescence values were normalized to the lowest fluorescence value. Upon applying ATP to roots expressing cell-specific GCaMP3 lines, we found similarities and differences in the resulting [Ca 2+ ] cyt signatures. For example, the PIN2:GCaMP3 lines, which expressed GCaMP3 in the epidermis and cortex ( Figure 2 ), displayed similar [Ca 2+ ] cyt signatures as UBQ10:GCaMP3 -expressing lines in response to ATP and the solvent control solution ( Figure 3 A,B). This is not surprising given that GCaMP3 is strongly expressed in both the epidermis and cortex under the control of the UBQ10 and PIN2 promoters ( Figure 1 and Figure 2 ). For lines expressing GCaMP3 in the trichoblasts, application of both ATP and MS control solution triggered a small increase in [Ca 2+ ] cyt that had similar patterns ( Figure 3 C). For lines expressing GCaMP3 in cells located in the root interior such as the cortex, endodermis, and columella ( supplementary video 1 ), ATP-induced [Ca 2+ ] cyt increases resembled the patterns of UBQ10:GCaMP3 and PIN2:GCaMP3 -expressing lines. However, the [Ca 2+ ] cyt increases triggered by application of MS control solution were not as prominent in these lines when compared to those lines in which GCaMP3 was expressed in the epidermis ( Figure 3 D–F). The next chemical we used to test the cell-specific GCaMP3 lines was glutamic acid ( Figure 4 ). Like ATP, glutamic acid (glutamate) is a neurotransmitter in mammalian cells that can trigger a [Ca 2+ ] cyt increase [ 5 , 14 ]. Application of glutamate to the elongation zone of roots expressing the UBQ10:GCaMP3 construct induced a strong initial [Ca 2+ ] cyt increase with a quick return to equilibrium ( Figure 4 A). The [Ca 2+ ] cyt spikes induced by application of MS controls were also observed in this dataset. Compared to glutamate, the onset of [Ca 2+ ] cyt increase was delayed in roots treated with MS solution. In this case, however, the [Ca 2+ ] cyt spikes triggered by glutamate and the MS control solution were similar in amplitude ( Figure 4 A). Like the ATP treatment, [Ca 2+ ] cyt response of roots expressing PIN2:GCaMP3 to glutamate was similar to roots expressing UBQ10:GCaMP3 . Furthermore, [Ca 2+ ] cyt changes in the root elongation zone of PIN2:GCaMP3 -expressing seedlings in response to the MS control solution was delayed, but exhibited a lower amplitude ( Figure 4 B). Lines expressing PRP3:GCaMP3 also had a strong initial [Ca 2+ ] cyt peak after glutamate treatment with a rapid return to equilibrium that resembled UBQ10:GCaMP3 and PIN2:GCaMP3 lines. Like UBQ10:GCaMP3 and PIN2:GCaMP3 lines, application of MS control solution elicited a [Ca 2+ ] cyt response that was delayed when compared to glutamate exposure ( Figure 4 C). By contrast, PEP:GCaMP3 -expressing lines showed a dampened response to glutamate compared to lines in which GCaMP3 was expressed in the root surface ( Figure 4 D). Close examination of the time course of [Ca 2+ ] cyt signals in the cortex after glutamate application revealed a triphasic response, with two larger peaks and a delayed smaller peak. Surprisingly, the amplitude of glutamate-triggered [Ca 2+ ] cyt increases in the cortex was less than that of MS treated roots ( Figure 4 D). The lines expressing SCR:GCaMP3 and ATHB8:GCaMP3 showed monophasic responses to glutamate with a gradual return to equilibrium, similar to lines in which GCaMP3 was expressed in root surface cells. Furthermore, unlike lines with GCaMP expressed in the cortex and root surface cells, the MS control solution response for endodermis- and columella- targeted GCaMP3 had delayed responses and lower amplitudes ( Figure 4 E,F). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Time course of [Ca 2+ ] cyt changes in A. thaliana roots after 1 mM glutamate (Glu) application. The leftmost panel shows an inverted fluorescence image of the terminal 300 μm of an A. thaliana primary root to illustrate different cell types in which GCaMP3 was expressed. Cell types are color coded with green = epidermis; blue = cortex; orange = endodermis; purple = columella; and the pink cells in the inset in panel C = trichoblast. ( A – F ) Quantification of [Ca 2+ ] cyt -dependent fluorescence of various lines expressing GCaMP3 after Glu and solvent control (0.5× MS) application. Black arrows indicate the time of treatment. Plotted values represent the average normalized fluorescence intensity from 3–4 regions of interest (ROI) per line with standard error bars every fifth time point. Fluorescence values were normalized to the lowest fluorescence value. The third chemical we tested against the cell-type specific GCaMP3 lines was Al 3+ in the form of aluminum chloride ( Figure 5 ). Al 3+ is a toxic tri-valent cation that competes with both Mg 2+ and Ca 2+ to increase the activity of Ca 2+ -ATPases while disrupting transport of Ca 2+ through the plasma membrane [ 5 , 29 ]. Similar to previous treatments, the root elongation zone of seedlings expressing UBQ10:GCaMP3 showed a monophasic [Ca 2+ ] cyt response to Al 3+ ( Figure 5 A). The onset of the [Ca 2+ ] cyt increase after Al 3+ treatment was delayed and lower in amplitude compared to ATP, glutamate and solvent control application ( Figure 3 A, Figure 4 A and Figure 5 A) [ 5 ]. In roots expressing PIN2:GCaMP3 , Al 3+ application elicited a biphasic [Ca 2+ ] cyt response that consisted of an initial small peak that was quickly followed by a second larger peak, which was broader than the first peak. The onset of the [Ca 2+ ] cyt response in PIN2:GCaMP3 -expressing roots after Al 3+ treatment occurred earlier than the [Ca 2+ ] cyt response triggered by solvent controls ( Figure 5 B). In roots expressing PRP3:GCaMP3 , Al 3+ -induced [Ca 2+ ] cyt increase was larger in amplitude and had a broader peak compared to those observed in UBQ10:GCaMP3 - and PIN2:GCaMP3 -expressing roots ( Figure 5 C). The [Ca 2+ ] cyt increases in roots expressing GCaMP3 in interior root tissues were less than roots expressing GCaMP3 in the surface tissues. Among the three lines in which GCaMP3 was expressed in the interior cell types, the columella-specific GCaMP3 line did not show an Al 3+ -induced [Ca 2+ ] cyt peak ( Figure 5 F). The PEP:GCaMP3 -expressing lines showed a biphasic [Ca 2+ ] cyt response with a distinct first peak followed by a second peak with lower amplitude. Although the amplitude of the [Ca 2+ ] cyt peak induced by application of MS solution was similar to the amplitude of the first Al 3+ -triggered [Ca 2+ ] cyt peak, the onset of the latter was delayed ( Figure 5 D). SCR:GCaMP3 -expressing roots exhibited an Al 3+ -induced [Ca 2+ ] cyt response characterized by a broad peak and with a lower amplitude than peaks observed in the root surface- and cortex GCaMP3 -expressing lines ( Figure 5 E). Figure 5. Open in a new tab Time course of [Ca 2+ ] cyt changes in A. thaliana roots after 1 mM aluminum (Al 3+ ) chloride application. The leftmost panel shows an inverted fluorescence image of the terminal 300 μm of an A. thaliana primary root to illustrate different cell types in which GCaMP3 was expressed. Cell types are color coded with green = epidermis; blue = cortex; orange = endodermis; purple = columella; and the pink cells in the inset in panel C = trichoblast. ( A – F ) Quantification of [Ca 2+ ] cyt -dependent fluorescence of various lines expressing GCaMP3 after Al 3+ and solvent control (0.5× MS) application. Black arrows indicate the time of treatment. Plotted values represent the average normalized fluorescence intensity from 3–7 regions of interest (ROI) per line with standard error bars every fifth time point. Fluorescence values were normalized to the lowest fluorescence value. The final stimulus we used to test the cell-type specific GCaMP3 lines was salt in the form of NaCl. Na + is used to regulate the voltage equilibrium in cells, but also has direct effects on the efflux of K + into the cytosol [ 30 ]. Ca 2+ is a regulator for the K + efflux channels [ 30 ], so disruption of K + into the cytosol may cause variation in the resting concentration of Ca 2+ . In roots expressing the fluorescent-based [Ca 2+ ] cyt sensor Yellow Cameleon 3.60 (YC3.60), NaCl treatment resulted in cell-specific [Ca 2+ ] cyt transients in the early elongation zone [ 31 ]. Consistent with the results of Feng et al. (2018) [ 31 ], roots expressing UBQ10:GCaMP3 exhibited late-onset [Ca 2+ ] cyt transients (i.e., >10 min) in cells of the elongation zone ( Figure 6 A; supplementary video 2 ). These NaCl-triggered [Ca 2+ ] cyt transients were observed in the cell-targeted GCaMP3 lines except for the endodermis-localized GCaMP3 line ( Figure 6 A–D). In certain lines, the onset of [Ca 2+ ] cyt transients occurred much earlier after NaCl application when compared to UBQ10:GCaMP3 -expressing lines. The onset of NaCl-induced [Ca 2+ ] cyt transients was fastest in roots of PRP3:GCaMP3 -expressing lines followed by PEP:GCaMP3 -expressing lines. The [Ca 2+ ] cyt transients in the columella were only observed several minutes after NaCl application (i.e., 12 min after NaCl application; Figure 6 C). Figure 6.

Modification of Growth Conditions and Chemical Application Methods to Mitigate Solvent Control-Induced [Ca 2+ ] cyt Transients As shown in the preceding sections, the 0.5X MS control solution induced [Ca 2+ ] cyt changes in UBQ10:GCaMP3 and lines in which GCaMP3 was expressed in cells on the root surface and cortex ( Figure 3 , Figure 4 and Figure 5 ). Although the MS-induced [Ca 2+ ] cyt responses were clearly distinct from ATP, glutamate, and Al 3+ treatments, we were concerned that the growth conditions in which these first experiments were conducted made roots more sensitive to osmotic changes and/or mechanical perturbation due to the process of adding the solutions. We argued that MS-induced [Ca 2+ ] cyt transients could be dampened relative to the chemical applications by: (1) using freshly prepared MS plates for planting seeds and (2) pretreating roots two times with MS solution prior to application of the actual chemical solution. These modifications in our treatment protocols were tested using ATP which typically generated peaks with the highest amplitude. Compared to the datasets shown in Figure 3 , Figure 4 and Figure 5 , the [Ca 2+ ] cyt transients triggered by the MS solution were significantly dampened when fresh plates were used for the experiments ( Figure 7 ). The dampened MS-induced [Ca 2+ ] cyt transients were observed in the two sequential MS applications. Pretreatment with MS solution had the added benefit of allowing roots to adapt prior to ATP application (adapted ATP = ATP:MS). Under these modified growth and pretreatment conditions, the ATP-induced [Ca 2+ ] cyt increases were lower in amplitude when compared to the [Ca 2+ ] cyt increases shown in Figure 3 . Despite the lower ATP-induced [Ca 2+ ] cyt transients, these [Ca 2+ ] cyt responses were better separated from the [Ca 2+ ] cyt responses induced by MS solution, particularly in lines expressing UBQ10:GCaMP3 and those in which GCaMP3 was expressed in root surface cell types and the cortex ( Figure 7 ). In addition to the dampened response, [Ca 2+ ] cyt response to ATP:MS for UBQ10:GCaMP3 and PIN2:GCaMP3 lines had broader peaks than those shown in Figure 3 . For PRP3:GCaMP3 -expressing lines, the [Ca 2+ ] cyt response was markedly different from the initial ATP treatment ( Figure 3 C and Figure 7 C). Application of ATP after 0.5X MS adaptation caused a strong, monophasic response earlier than either UBQ10:GCaMP3 or PIN2:GCaMP3 lines. Lines expressing PEP:GCaMP3 showed a continued elevated [Ca 2+ ] cyt response that oscillated throughout the 10 min time course compared to either UBQ10:GCaMP3 lines or the previous ATP treatment ( Figure 3 D and Figure 7 D). For lines expressing SCR:GCaMP3 or ATHB8:GCaMP3 , the response was similar to previous ATP treatments, but without the strong transient peak ( Figure 3 E,F and Figure 7 E,F). After the cell-type specific lines were adapted to the 0.5× MS control solution, the response time for ATP:MS was initiated later than the previous ATP treatment ( Table 1 ). Figure 7.

To further tease out the differences among GCaMP3 -expressing lines, we obtained the time elapsed from chemical application to maximum GCaMP3 fluorescence (referred to as reaction time), and analyzed the relationship between chemicals using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with Tukey Post-Hoc test ( Table 1 ). Our analysis showed that reaction time was delayed in lines where GCaMP3 was expressed in inner cell types. When comparing the different chemical treatments, ATP, glutamate, and Al 3+ showed similar responses (except ATHB8:GCaMP3 to Al 3+ ) while adapted ATP:MS showed significantly slower reaction times to both ATP and glutamate ( Table 1 ). However, with such a small sample size, statistical significance may indicate a trend rather than actual significance. NaCl reaction time was not included due to the large variation in responses across each line. 2.4. Evaluation of [Ca 2+ ] cyt Signatures from Similar Root Development Regions and Cell Types In comparing UBQ10:GCaMP3 lines with the other cell-type specific GCaMP3 lines, a ROI was selected and the average of normalized fluorescence intensity was plotted. For the most part, the ROI in UBQ10:GCaMP3 lines was from the root epidermis and the average normalized fluorescence intensity from this ROI was compared with that of individual or groups of cells from the cell-type specific GCaMP3 lines. This process did not enable direct comparisons of [Ca 2+ ] cyt signatures between the same cell types or root developmental regions. To address this issue, we conducted another set of imaging experiments using ATP-treated UBQ10:GCaMP3 and PIN2:GCaMP3 lines. For these experiments, a more direct comparison was conducted by drawing ROIs in epidermal cells from similar positions along the root longitudinal axis encompassing the meristem, distal elongation zone, and central elongation zone ( Figure 8 A). In doing so, we found similarities and differences in [Ca 2+ ] cyt signatures between UBQ10:GCaMP3 and PIN2:GCaMP3 lines. For example, the ATP-induced [Ca 2+ ] cyt signatures of UBQ10:GCaMP3 in all root developmental regions were identical to those in the distal and central elongation zone of PIN2:GCaMP3 lines. In PIN2:GCaMP3 lines, however, the ATP-induced [Ca 2+ ] cyt signature had a much greater amplitude in the meristem ( Figure 8 A,B). Figure 8. Open in a new tab Direct comparison of ATP-induced [Ca 2+ ] cyt signatures in equivalent root developmental regions between UBQ10:GCaMP3 and cell-type specific GCaMP3 lines. Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn in the meristem, distal elongation zone (DEZ), and central elongation zone (CEZ) in UBQ10:GCaMP3 ( A ) and PIN2:GCaMP3 ( B ) roots (inset in A). Comparison of ATP-induced [Ca 2+ ] cyt signatures in presumptive columella and endodermis of UBQ10:GCaMP3 lines with ATHB8:GCaMP3 ( C ) and SCR:GCaMP3 ( D ). Black arrows indicate the time of treatment. Plotted values represent the average normalized fluorescence intensity from 3-4 ROI per line with standard error bars every fifth time point. Fluorescence values were normalized to the lowest fluorescence value. We extended our analysis by drawing ROIs in presumptive columella or endodermis of UBQ10:GCaMP3 and comparing the resulting [Ca 2+ ] cyt signatures from these ROIs with those of ATHB8:GCaMP3 and SCR:GCaMP3 . For the columella, we found that ATHB8:GCaMP3 lines displayed an ATP-triggered [Ca 2+ ] cyt signature with a sustained peak throughout the 10 min time course. On the other hand, the ATP-induced [Ca 2+ ] cyt signature from the presumptive columella region of UBQ10:GCaMP3 lines was transient ( Figure 8 C). For the endodermis, the peak of ATP-induced [Ca 2+ ] cyt increase was higher in UBQ10:GCaMP3 when compared to SCR:GCaMP3 ( Figure 8 D).",

  "ai_summary": "This study investigates the dynamics of cytoplasmic calcium ([Ca²⁺] cyt) signaling in different cell types of Arabidopsis thaliana seedling roots using genetically-encoded calcium indicators (GCaMP3). Recognizing that various root cell types may respond differently to environmental stimuli, the researchers developed lines expressing GCaMP3 in five specific cell types: columella, endodermis, cortex, epidermis, and trichoblasts. Through confocal microscopy, they observed distinct [Ca²⁺] cyt responses to treatments with ATP, glutamate, aluminum, and salt, revealing both similarities and differences in calcium signaling patterns among the cell types. Notably, the study found that the responses could be influenced by growth conditions, suggesting that methodological adjustments can enhance the reliability of calcium signaling measurements. These findings enhance our understanding of plant cellular responses to environmental changes, which is crucial for advancing space biosciences, particularly in developing resilient crops for long-duration space missions where environmental conditions can be unpredictable.",
