    "abstract": "The trans -Golgi network (TGN) is a dynamic organelle that functions as a relay station for receiving endocytosed cargo, directing secretory cargo, and trafficking to the vacuole. TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein (TNO1) is a large, TGN-localized, coiled-coil protein that associates with the membrane fusion protein SYP41, a target SNARE, and is required for efficient protein trafficking to the vacuole. Here, we show that a tno1 mutant has auxin transport-related defects. Mutant roots have delayed lateral root emergence, decreased gravitropic bending of plant organs and increased sensitivity to the auxin analog 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and the natural auxin 3-indoleacetic acid. Auxin asymmetry at the tips of elongating stage II lateral roots was reduced in the tno1 mutant, suggesting a role for TNO1 in cellular auxin transport during lateral root emergence. During gravistimulation, tno1 roots exhibited delayed auxin transport from the columella to the basal epidermal cells. Endocytosis to the TGN was unaffected in the mutant, indicating that bulk endocytic defects are not responsible for the observed phenotypes. Together these studies demonstrate a role for TNO1 in mediating auxin responses during root development and gravistimulation, potentially through trafficking of auxin transport proteins.

    "methods": "Plant Material and Growth Conditions The A. thaliana seed stocks used in this study have been previously described: Col-0 (wild-type, WT), tno1 knockout mutant (SALK_112503; Kim and Bassham, 2011 ), complemented tno1 mutant ( Kim and Bassham, 2011 ), and DR5rev:GFP ( Ottenschlager et al., 2003 ). Arabidopsis seeds were surface-sterilized in 33% bleach, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 20 min, rinsed five times with sterile water and kept in the dark at 4°C for at least 2 days. Arabidopsis plants were grown at 22°C in long-day conditions (16 h light) in soil or on 0.25× or 0.5× solid Murashige–Skoog (MS) medium (MS vitamin and salt mixture, Caisson, MSPA0910) with 1% sucrose, 2.4 mM MES (pH 5.7), and 0.6% (w/v) phytoblend agar (Caisson, PTP01). Gravitropism Assays The hypocotyl gravitropism assay was modified from Stanga et al. (2009) . Seeds were plated on 0.5× MS medium ( Murashige and Skoog, 1962 ) containing 1% sucrose in square plates and kept vertically oriented in the dark. After 5 days, the plates were rotated 90° for gravistimulation. Pictures were acquired using a Canon Rebel XTS camera in a dark room with a green filter over the flash to prevent phototropic curvature of the hypocotyl toward the camera flash. Zero-hour images of each seedling were compared to later time point images of the same seedling using Image J ( Schneider et al., 2012 ) to determine bending angles. For root gravitropic assays, sterilized seeds were mixed with molten growth medium just before solidification and poured into square plates ( Stanga et al., 2009 ). After 5 days of vertical growth the seedlings were gravistimulated by rotating the plate by 90°. Pictures were taken 6 and 24 h after gravistimulation and analyzed using Image J to assess gravitropic curvature. For root and hypocotyl gravitropic rescue assays, the roots of 5-day-old vertically grown seedlings were overlaid with media containing either 100 nM 1-napthylacetic acid (1-NAA; Sigma–Aldrich, N0640), 30 nM 3-indoleacetic acid (IAA; Sigma–Aldrich, I2886), or 30 nM 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D; Gibco, 11215), followed by gravistimulation. Pictures of roots and hypocotyls after 12 h were compared to 0-h images using Image J. For all assays, at least three biological replicates were performed, with 15–20 seedlings per replicate. LR Density Analysis To determine the density of emerging LRs, sterilized Arabidopsis seeds were plated on 0.25× MS medium ( Murashige and Skoog, 1962 ) containing 1% sucrose and grown vertically. After 10 days, the number of LRs emerging from the primary root were counted and divided by the root length to obtain LR density. For determination of LR primordia density, 7-day-old roots were cleared with 2.5% bleach for 10 min and visualized with an Olympus IX-71 inverted microscope. To assess rescue of LR emergence, 5-day-old seedlings were transferred to medium containing 100 nM 1-NAA or 1 μM IAA in the dark (to prevent photo-degradation). After 5 additional days, the number of emergent LRs was scored. For each analysis, three independent biological replicates were performed with 15–20 seedlings per replicate. Root Length Inhibition Assays Seedlings were grown on 0.5× MS medium ( Murashige and Skoog, 1962 ) with 1% sucrose for 5 days. They were then transferred to media containing either 2,4-D, IAA, 1-NAA, 1- N -naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA; Naptalam, Sigma–Aldrich, 33371), 1-napthoxyacetic acid (1-NOA; Sigma–Aldrich, 255416) at the concentrations indicated, or solvent controls [dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or ethanol], and the position of the root tip was marked. Each plate contained all three genotypes (WT, tno1 mutant, and complemented lines) to compensate for possible effects of inter-plate variation. After 6 days, pictures were acquired and the length from the marked root tip position was measured using ImageJ ( Schneider et al., 2012 ). Root elongation in the presence of the tested chemicals was compared with solvent controls and expressed as percent decrease in root length. At least three biological replicates with a minimum of 20 seedlings per replicate were conducted for each treatment. Analysis of Auxin Response Distribution tno1 plants expressing DR5rev:GFP were generated by crossing tno1 ( Kim and Bassham, 2011 ) with DR5rev:GFP lines ( Ottenschlager et al., 2003 ). Homozygous tno1 plants carrying the DR5rev:GFP transgene were selected in subsequent generations by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based genotyping as previously described ( Kim and Bassham, 2011 ) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) fluorescence visualization. For analysis of auxin redistribution, control and tno1 roots expressing DR5rev:GFP were gravistimulated and visualized with a Leica SP5 confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems) at the Iowa State University Confocal and Multiphoton facility. A 40× oil immersion objective lens was used along with excitation and emission wavelengths of 488 and 507 nm for GFP visualization. Images were acquired under identical conditions for both mutant and WT roots with equal exposure, scan frequency and line average settings. A total of 15 seedlings from at least three independent replicates were analyzed. GFP asymmetry was quantified using Image J by subjecting the confocal images to similar thresholding and post-processing. Equal volume boxes were drawn on the upper and lower flanks and total pixel intensity from the lower vs. upper box was expressed as a ratio. To analyze DR5rev:GFP expression in LRs, a total of 30 stage II LRs from at least six different seedlings were imaged by confocal microscopy for each genotype. The number of root tips showing asymmetry of GFP expression was counted and expressed as a percentage of the total observed. FM4-64 Staining and Brefeldin A (BFA) Treatment FM4-64 staining was modified from Dettmer et al. (2006) . To test bulk endocytosis, 4-day-old seedlings were transferred to 0.5× MS liquid medium containing 4 μM FM4-64 for 2 min and subsequently washed twice for 30 s each time in 0.5× MS liquid medium before microscopic analysis. For analyzing arrival of FM4-64 at Brefeldin A bodies, 4-day-old seedlings were transferred to 0.5× MS liquid medium containing 35 μM Brefeldin A (BFA) for an hour followed by a 10-min treatment with 4 μM FM4-64 plus 35 μM BFA and two subsequent washes of 30 s each. The root tips were visualized using a Leica SP5 confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems) at the Iowa State University Confocal and Multiphoton facility, using a 63× oil immersion objective lens and excitation and emission wavelengths of 558 and 734 nm. Images were acquired under identical conditions for both genotypes with equal exposure, scan frequency and line average settings. A total of 15 seedlings from at least three independent replicates were analyzed for each treatment and genotype.",
    "results": "TNO1 Mediates LR Emergence in an Auxin-dependent Manner Auxin signaling pathways are integral to LR development during root architecture establishment ( Lavenus et al., 2013 ). Polar auxin transport mediates emergence of LRs from the primary axis, and several auxin transport mutants display slow rates of emergence ( Hobbie and Estelle, 1995 ; Ruegger et al., 1997 ). The SYP4 family of SNAREs is thought to be involved in directional auxin transport ( Uemura et al., 2012 ), hence we tested whether the SYP41-interacting protein TNO1 may also be required for such processes. We hypothesized that if the tno1 mutant has defects in auxin transport or responses, visible phenotypes such as changes in LR emergence would be evident. Emergent LR densities were significantly lower ( P < 0.05) in tno1 seedlings after 10 days of growth on 0.25× MS medium ( Dubrovsky and Forde, 2012 ). Mutant lines expressing transgenic TNO1 under the control of its native promoter, termed complemented lines ( Kim and Bassham, 2011 ), were similar to WT seedlings ( Figures 1A,B ). Since the major source of auxin in the root in the first 10 days after germination is transport from the leaves ( Hobbie and Estelle, 1995 ; Ljung et al., 2001 ), one possible reason for this defect may be that auxin flux is reduced in tno1 , leading to suboptimal auxin levels in the root and impairing LR emergence. To confirm that the delayed emergence was not due to an arrest or delay in LR initiation, the number of LR primordia was evaluated in the mutant roots. The LR primordia density of tno1 roots was equivalent to that of WT and complemented lines ( Figure 1C ), suggesting that LR initiation events were normal in tno1 . FIGURE 1. Open in a new tab Loss of TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein ( TNO1) function delays lateral root emergence in an auxin-dependent fashion. (A) Representative images showing emergent lateral roots (white arrowheads) in wild-type (WT), tno1 (KO), and tno1 complemented (COM) lines. (B) Emergent lateral root density of 10-day-old seedlings grown on 0.25× Murashige–Skoog (MS) medium (with 1% sucrose) was calculated by dividing the number of emerging lateral roots by root length. (C) Lateral root primordia density of 7-day-old seedlings was calculated by counting the number of primordia after microscopic analysis of cleared roots and dividing it by the root length. (D) Emergent LR density of 10-day-old seedlings, 5 days after transfer to medium containing 100 nM 1-napthylacetic acid (NAA) or 1 μM indoleacetic acid (IAA). All values represent analysis of three biological replicates with 15–20 seedlings for each set. Error bars indicate standard errors of the means. Asterisk indicates statistically significant difference ( P < 0.05) by Student’s t -test. The lipophilic auxin 1-NAA has been shown to rescue LR defects in the auxin transport mutant aux1 ( Marchant et al., 2002 ). Natural auxin (IAA) treatment also rescues LR emergence in dark conditions ( Reed et al., 1998 ). To test whether the emergence defect may be due to defects in auxin transport and hence reduced root auxin levels, LR emergence in the presence of 1-NAA ( Murashige and Skoog, 1962 ; Marchant et al., 2002 ) or IAA in the dark ( Reed et al., 1998 ) was assessed. Five-day-old seedlings were transferred to medium containing 100 nM NAA or 1 μM IAA, and LR density was analyzed after 5 days of growth. The LR density of tno1 resembled that of WT and complemented lines in the presence of either auxin ( Figure 1D ), indicating that exogenous auxins can rescue the emergent LR defect in tno1 roots. Therefore, TNO1 influences the temporal control of LR emergence from the primary root. TNO1 is Required for Gravitropic Bending We further examined a possible role for TNO1 in plant auxin responses by investigating gravitropism. Gravitropism involves the bending of a plant organ in response to its change in orientation with respect to gravity (gravistimulation). Gravitropic bending of organs upon gravistimulation is aided by a readjustment of auxin flow. Since a number of proteins involved in gravitropic curvature are recycled and trafficked via the TGN ( Strohm et al., 2012 ), this organelle is critical for regulating downstream events that influence gravitropic plant organ bending. We, therefore, hypothesized that loss of TNO1 might affect dynamics at the TGN and thus lead to a change in the gravitropic bending response. To test this hypothesis, the gravitropic response of WT and tno1 mutant hypocotyls and roots was assessed. The tno1 mutant hypocotyls ( Figure 2A ) and roots ( Figure 2B ) showed delayed bending, and the angle of curvature at different time points was significantly lower ( P < 0.05) than that of WT or complemented seedlings. This suggests that the loss of TNO1 causes a delay in the gravitropic bending of Arabidopsis roots and hypocotyls. Mutant roots and hypocotyls have a similar length to WT under normal growth conditions ( Kim and Bassham, 2011 ), suggesting that the defect in gravitropism is not due to defective growth. FIGURE 2. Open in a new tab TNO1 mediates gravitropic bending by an auxin dependent mechanism. (A) Hypocotyl bending of WT, KO and COM hypocotyls after gravistimulation. Dark-grown 5-day-old hypocotyls were gravistimulated in the dark and curvatures were calculated at 6 and 24 h after gravistimulation. (B) Root bending of WT, KO, and COM seedlings after gravistimulation. Light-grown, medium-embedded roots were gravistimulated and root curvatures were calculated at 6 and 24 h after gravistimulation. (C) Exogenous auxins can rescue the gravitropic bending defect in tno1 roots. Light-grown seedlings were overlaid with medium containing 100 mM 1-NAA, 30 nM IAA, or 30 nM 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and then gravistimulated. Root curvatures were calculated after 12 h. (D) Some exogenous auxins can rescue the gravitropic bending defect in tno1 hypocotyls. Roots of dark-grown seedlings were overlaid with medium containing 100 mM 1-NAA, 30 nM IAA, or 30 nM 2,4-D, followed by gravistimulation. Hypocotyl curvatures were calculated after 12 h. All values represent the means of three biological replicates with at least 20 seedlings for each set. Error bars indicate standard errors. Similar letters indicate no statistical difference while different letters indicate a statistically significant difference ( P < 0.05) by Student’s t -test. The gravitropic bending response requires a reprogramming of auxin flow inside the shoot and root ( Tanaka et al., 2006 ; Strohm et al., 2012 ), raising the possibility that the slower bending rate observed in tno1 could be due to changes in auxin flow. We hypothesized that if the gravitropic phenotype in tno1 mutants is due to defect(s) in auxin transport, it may be rescued by exogenous auxin application. To test this idea, we used the membrane-permeable auxin 1-NAA, which has been previously used to rescue gravitropic root bending defects in mutants defective in auxin transport ( Marchant et al., 1999 ), the natural auxin IAA, and the influx-specific auxin 2,4-D. Following auxin treatments, the bending angles of tno1 roots were not significantly different ( P > 0.1) from the bending angles of the WT and complemented lines ( Figure 2C ), indicating rescue of the gravitropic bending defect by exogenous auxin. The 2,4-D treatment led to an overall reduction of bending angles as has been previously reported ( Surpin et al., 2005 ) but there were no significant differences between WT and mutant. Similarly, hypocotyl bending was also rescued after a 12-h treatment with either IAA or 1-NAA ( Figure 2D ), confirming that the gravitropic defect in tno1 mutants is most likely due to auxin-related defects. 2,4-D did not rescue the gravitropic defect in the mutant hypocotyls, with bending angles significantly lower than WT and complemented lines; this is consistent with previous reports demonstrating an effect of 2,4-D on gravitropism in roots but not in hypocotyls ( Surpin et al., 2005 ). The tno1 mutant defects in gravitropic bending, therefore, may be due to defects in auxin transport or response. tno1 Roots Show Increased Sensitivity to 2,4-D and IAA Auxin flux into plant cells is facilitated by influx carriers such as AUX1 and the LAX family of transporters, while exit from the cell involves eﬄux carriers belonging to the PIN and PGP families ( Peer et al., 2011 ). Auxin analogs and transport inhibitors are important tools to uncover defects in auxin transport pathways. The auxin analog 2,4-D is an influx-specific substrate while 1-NAA is an eﬄux-specific substrate ( Delbarre et al., 1996 ). The auxin transport inhibitor NPA interferes with auxin eﬄux while 1-NOA interferes with auxin influx and inhibits AUX1 ( Thomson et al., 1973 ; Sussman and Goldsmith, 1981 ; Yang et al., 2006 ). To determine the effect of these inhibitors on the tno1 mutant, their effects on root growth were assessed. We found that tno1 roots were significantly ( P < 0.05) more sensitive to 30 nM 2,4-D than WT or complemented roots ( Figure 3A ). This result is consistent with our observation of the failure of 2,4-D to rescue the gravitropic defect of mutant hypocotyls. FIGURE 3. Open in a new tab tno1 roots show increased sensitivity to 2,4-D and IAA. Five-day-old seedlings were transferred to media with the indicated chemical or solvent as a control and root length was calculated after an additional 6 days of growth. Mean root growth of each genotype on the chemical treatment compared to the mean on the solvent control was expressed as percentage inhibition. Percent inhibition of root length on (A) 30 nM 2,4-D, (B) 1-1-napthoxyacetic acid (NOA; 30, 50, and 70 μM), (C) 30 nM 2,4-D + 10 μM 1-NOA, (D) 40 nM IAA, (E) 100 nM 1-NAA, and (F) 1- N -naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA; 5 and 10 μM) for WT, KO, and COM lines are shown. Values represent analysis of three biological replicates with 20 seedlings for each set. Error bars indicate standard errors derived from means of the three replicates. Different letters indicate statistically significant differences ( P < 0.05) by a Student’s t -test. One possible explanation for this sensitivity is that influx routes are altered in the tno1 mutant, which led us to test the effect of blocking auxin influx with 1-NOA. Mutant roots showed similar sensitivity to WT and complemented lines across a range of concentrations of 1-NOA ( Figure 3B ), suggesting that blocking auxin influx affects the tno1 mutant to the same extent as wild-type. 1-NOA has a characteristic protective effect against root growth inhibition by 2,4-D ( Parry et al., 2001 ); we, therefore, tested whether 1-NOA could rescue the root growth inhibition of mutant roots by 2,4-D to comparable levels as in the WT and complemented lines. Seedlings were transferred to medium containing 30 nM 2,4-D and 10 μM 1-NOA. The WT and complemented lines showed a significantly lower inhibition of root length than the mutants ( P < 0.05), indicating that when auxin influx is blocked, tno1 mutants still have enhanced sensitivity to 2,4-D ( Figure 3C ). To determine whether the sensitivity to 2,4-D is also seen with other auxins, root growth inhibition on 40 nM IAA in the dark was assessed. tno1 mutant roots are indeed more sensitive to IAA ( P < 0.05) than WT or complemented lines ( Figure 3D ). By contrast, treatment with 0.1 μM of the membrane-permeable NAA inhibited the growth of tno1 to a similar extent as WT and complemented plants ( Figure 3E ). Since 2,4-D and IAA are influx-specific substrates and NAA is not, the results are consistent with a possible defect in auxin influx pathways in tno1 . tno1 , WT, and complemented plants had similar responses to NPA treatment ( Figure 3F ), suggesting that the auxin eﬄux pathway is unaffected in tno1 . TNO1 Helps Mediate Auxin Responses during LR Elongation Lateral roots emerge perpendicular to the primary root and gradually start bending rootwards. Recently emerged LRs, which lack an elongation zone (stage I LR) gradually transition into stage II LRs, defined by an elongation zone and asymmetric growth of the upper and lower epidermal cell files ( Rosquete et al., 2013 ). The differential growth peaks in the stage II LRs are due to asymmetric auxin distribution, which in turn is dependent on auxin transport mechanisms. Stage II LRs are thus defined by a characteristic asymmetric distribution of auxin response, which results in differential cellular elongation and downward root growth. This asymmetric auxin flux at the LR tip is caused by the specific activity and distribution of auxin transporters ( Rosquete et al., 2013 ). The asymmetric auxin distribution pattern diminishes significantly as the LRs mature to Stage III and begin growing parallel to the primary root. It was reported that on average more than 75% of stage II LRs in WT plants display asymmetric distribution of auxin responses at LR tips ( Rosquete et al., 2013 ), visualized by the pattern of DR5rev:GFP expression ( Friml et al., 2003 ). Since TNO1 is linked to LR emergence by a possible auxin-dependent mechanism, we hypothesized that asymmetric auxin transport or response is defective in tno1 LRs. Hence, the percentage of LRs showing asymmetric auxin responses in stage II tno1 LR tips would be lower compared to WT (or complemented) root tips. To test this, the percentage of stage II LRs with auxin response asymmetry in WT and tno1 background lines expressing DR5rev:GFP was determined by confocal microscopy. 40% of tno1 stage II LRs displayed auxin asymmetry at the LR tip compared to 80% in WT stage II LRs ( Figures 4A,B ). Thus, tno1 roots are defective in establishing the correct pattern of auxin response during LR development. This defect could explain the lower emergent LR density observed in tno1 compared to WT, since a disruption of auxin flow or establishment of asymmetry would prevent LR emergence. FIGURE 4. Open in a new tab TNO1 helps mediate auxin response asymmetry at lateral root (LR) tips. (A) Representative confocal images of stage II LR tips of WT and tno1 expressing the auxin-responsive DR5rev:GFP reporter. Yellow arrowheads indicate asymmetry of the auxin reporter GFP expression. Scale bar = 50 μm. (B) The percentage of stage II LRs displaying an asymmetric auxin response pattern. A total of 30 stage II LRs from at least six seedlings were analyzed. TNO1 Facilitates Shootward Auxin Response during Root Bending Normally, gravitropic bending of the primary root leads to an eventual return of the root tip toward the gravity vector. This occurs via a cascade of signals leading to asymmetric auxin flow from the columella cells to the lateral rootcap cells and eventually shootward through the epidermal and cortical cells (moving toward the root–shoot junction). During this process, auxin accumulates on the lower side of the root, leading to growth inhibition, while the top of the root continues to elongate, thus resulting in downward root bending ( Ottenschlager et al., 2003 ; Kleine-Vehn et al., 2010 ; Baldwin et al., 2012 ). Since tno1 roots are defective in gravitropic bending ( Figure 2 ) and the frequency of LR tips displaying auxin response asymmetry is lower than in WT LRs ( Figure 4 ), we hypothesized that the defect in root bending could be due to a decrease in shootward transport of auxin from the columella to the lateral rootcap cells and on to the distal elongation zone. To test this hypothesis, vertical plate-grown WT and tno1 seedlings expressing DR5rev:GFP were gravistimulated by rotating the plates by 90°. Confocal images were acquired before gravistimulation and subsequently at 5, 8, and 12 h after gravistimulation for both WT and tno1 root tips ( Figures 5A–D ). In the WT background, GFP fluorescence progressed shootward from the columella toward the lateral rootcap and epidermal cells of the lower side of the root. Conversely, the shootward appearance of fluorescence in tno1 was severely inhibited and failed to reach WT levels (arrowheads in Figures 5B–D ). The difference in GFP fluorescence intensity on the upper and lower flanks was expressed as a ratio for each genotype at different time points. This ratio was significantly higher for WT roots than for tno1 mutants at all time-points, suggesting a stronger response in WT than in the mutants ( Figure 5E ). This in turn implies that the defect in gravitropic bending in tno1 mutants may be due to a decrease in auxin transport, or a difference in auxin response, from the columella to the lateral rootcap and epidermal cells on the lower side of the gravistimulated root. Such a defect could explain the reduced bending observed in tno1 roots. Since auxin asymmetry within LR tips has been suggested to occur by a similar mechanism ( Rosquete et al., 2013 ), this could also explain the lower percentage of stage II LRs displaying auxin response asymmetry in tno1 . FIGURE 5. Open in a new tab tno1 mutants have delayed auxin responses in epidermal cells in gravistimulated roots. Representative confocal images of mutant and WT primary root tips showing DR5rev:GFP expression under (A) vertical (non-gravistimulated condition), (B) 5 h gravistimulation, (C) 8 h gravistimulation, and (D) 12 h gravistimulation. Yellow arrowheads indicate auxin reporter expression expanding from columella to epidermal cells of the elongation zone. Scale bar = 50 μm. (E) Quantification of DR5rev :GFP asymmetry as a ratio of fluorescence intensity on the lower and upper flanks of gravistimulated roots at the indicated time points. Values are means from analysis of 10 roots for each time point and error bars indicate standard errors. Similar letters indicate no statistical difference while different letters indicate a statistically significant difference ( P < 0.05) by Student’s t -test. TNO1 is not Required for Bulk Endocytosis Auxin transporters such as the PIN proteins are continuously endocytosed to the TGN and recycled back to the plasma membrane to maintain an appropriate density, thus allowing steady auxin flux through plant cells ( Kleine-Vehn and Friml, 2008 ; Friml, 2010 ). Defects in endocytosis and components involved in the endocytic route to the TGN can, therefore, cause a defect in auxin transport pathways. Since tno1 mutants show defects in TGN dynamics ( Kim and Bassham, 2011 ) and display auxin-related defects, we hypothesized that loss of TNO1 might alter endocytic routes and/or arrival of cargo at the TGN. This in turn would manifest in altered auxin transporter trafficking dynamics, and subsequently alter auxin responses. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed endocytosis in root epidermal cells using the lipophilic styryl dye FM4-64, which is endocytosed and labels early endosomes. To capture early endocytic events, roots of 4-day-old seedlings were stained with 4 μM FM4-64 for 2 min and then washed twice for 30 s each time in MS medium. Both WT and tno1 root cells showed similar endosome labeling patterns ( Figure 6A , yellow arrowheads), suggesting that bulk endocytic uptake is normal in tno1 roots. FIGURE 6. Open in a new tab tno1 mutants have normal bulk endocytosis and arrival of membrane cargo from plasma membrane to Brefeldin A (BFA) bodies. (A) Root cells showing uptake of FM4-64 after 2 min of treatment of 4-day-old seedlings with 4 μM FM4-64 in liquid 0.5× MS medium. Yellow arrowheads indicate early endosomes/TGN. (B) Root cells treated with 35 μM BFA for 1 h, followed by a 10 min incubation with 4 μM FM4-64, showing arrival of FM4-64 at BFA bodies. White arrowheads indicate BFA bodies. To confirm that bulk endocytosis was unaffected and that endocytic vesicles are delivered normally to the TGN in the mutant, the incorporation of FM4-64 into BFA bodies was assessed. The fungal toxin BFA causes aggregation of the TGN and TGN-derived endosomes to form BFA bodies ( Geldner et al., 2001 ; Dettmer et al., 2006 ; Lam et al., 2009 ). BFA body formation is delayed in tno1 cotyledons but occurs at similar rates in root cells of WT and tno1 mutants ( Kim and Bassham, 2011 ). It was hypothesized that if tno1 has defects in the delivery of endocytosed material to the TGN, then FM4-64 labeling of BFA bodies in tno1 roots would be reduced compared with WT roots. To test this hypothesis, 5-day-old WT and mutant seedlings were incubated with 35 μM BFA for an hour to allow formation of BFA bodies. They were then stained with 4 μM FM4-64 for 10 min in the presence of BFA, followed by two washes in MS medium containing BFA. The BFA bodies in both WT and tno1 roots showed normal FM4-64 staining ( Figure 6B , white arrowheads) after 10 min. Thus, loss of TNO1 does not affect bulk endocytosis and membrane flow from the plasma membrane to the TGN in root cells.",
