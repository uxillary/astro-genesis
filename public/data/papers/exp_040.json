    "abstract": "Root hairs are single-cell protrusions that enable roots to optimize nutrient and water acquisition. These structures attain their tubular shapes by confining growth to the cell apex, a process called tip growth. The actin cytoskeleton and endomembrane systems are essential for tip growth; however, little is known about how these cellular components coordinate their activities during this process. Here, we show that SPIRRIG (SPI), a beige and Chediak Higashi domain-containing protein involved in membrane trafficking, and BRK1 and SCAR2, subunits of the WAVE/SCAR (W/SC) actin nucleating promoting complex, display polarized localizations in Arabidopsis thaliana root hairs during distinct developmental stages. SPI accumulates at the root hair apex via post-Golgi compartments and positively regulates tip growth by maintaining tip-focused vesicle secretion and filamentous-actin integrity. BRK1 and SCAR2 on the other hand, mark the root hair initiation domain to specify the position of root hair emergence. Consistent with the localization data, tip growth was reduced in spi and the position of root hair emergence was disrupted in brk1 and scar1234 . BRK1 depletion coincided with SPI accumulation as root hairs transitioned from initiation to tip growth. Taken together, our work uncovers a role for SPI in facilitating actin-dependent root hair development in Arabidopsis through pathways that might intersect with W/SC.",
    "methods": "Forward-genetic screening and map-based cloning The A. thaliana hlb mutants from which the spi-5 mutant allele was identified were isolated from a population of T-DNA seeds (Arabidopsis Biological Research Center stock CS31100). Plants generated from these seeds were transformed with the activation tagging pSKI015 plasmid ( Weigel et al., 2000 ; Sparks et al., 2016 ; Sun et al., 2019 ). Briefly, mutagenized seeds were surface sterilized in 95% (v/v) ethanol and 20% bleach (v/v), followed by three washes in sterile deionized water. A solution of 0.5× Murashige and Skoog (MS) basal salt medium with vitamins (PhytoTech Labs, USA) and 1% (w/v) sucrose was prepared, and the pH of the solution was adjusted to 5.7. After adding 0.5% agar (w/v) (Sigma-Aldrich), the solution was autoclaved and allowed to cool at room temperature. Upon reaching 55°C, a stock solution of 10-mM LatB (CalBiochem-EMD Chemicals) in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to make a final LatB concentration of 100 nM. Sterilized seeds were suspended in the MS–agar–LatB medium and gently swirled to evenly distribute the seeds. The seed–MS–agar–LatB mixture was poured to a thickness of 2 mm on the bases of 10 cm × 10 cm Petri dishes. After incubating the plates at 4°C for 48 h, they were positioned vertically in a Conviron plant growth chamber set to 24°C with a 14-h light (120 µmol m −2 s −1 )/10-h dark cycle. Six days after transfer to the Conviron growth chamber, seedlings that exhibited severe growth inhibition were transplanted to LatB-free medium and grown to maturity. For LatB hypersensitivity assays, seeds from selected plants and the hlb2 mutant were planted on the surface of a 3 mm layer of polymerized 0.5× MS—1% agar growth medium in gridded square 10 cm × 10 cm Petri plates and grown in the same Conviron used for screening. Four-day-old seedlings with primary roots that were ∼1 cm long were selected. Selected seedlings were transplanted to a new set of square Petri dishes containing MS medium supplemented with 50-nM LatB or MS supplemented with the appropriate volume of LatB solvent (i.e. DMSO). During transplantation, the tip of the root was positioned at the grid line of the Petri dish and maintained in a vertical orientation. Four days after transplanting, images of the roots were captured with a Nikon Insight digital camera mounted on a copy stand. Primary root length was expressed as the distance between the position of the root tip 4 d after transplantation and the grid line where the root tip was positioned during transplantation ( Supplemental Figure S1 ). To identify the HLB2 gene, homozygous hlb2 (Col-0 ecotype) was out-crossed to the Landsberg erecta ecotype to generate seeds for map-based cloning because attempts to identify the responsible mutation for the hlb2 phenotype using TAIL-PCR had been unsuccessful. Segregating F2 seedlings were surface sterilized as described above and grown for 3 d. These seedlings were then transferred to MS medium containing 50 nM LatB and root lengths were marked on the plates to track root growth. Transferred seedlings were grown vertically for an additional 4 d in the growth chamber and seedlings that showed root hypersensitivity to 50-nM LatB were selected for mapping. Briefly, DNA was extracted ( Edwards et al., 1991 ) from approximately 2,600 LatB sensitive seedlings and cloned with simple sequence length polymorphism and cleavage of amplified polymorphic site markers to chromosome one between the AT1G02740 and AT1G03410 loci ( Lukowitz et al., 2000 ), which spanned 248 kb and contained 77 annotated genes. Primers were then designed to several candidate genes based on the sequenced 248-kb region. Nucleotide sequencing revealed that the hlb2 mutation had a 10-base pair deletion (Chr1 position 720, 152–720, 161) in exon 14 of the AT1G03060 gene. In addition, we obtained a T-DNA insertional mutant (SALK_065311) from the ABRC with a predicted insertion in SPI . After genotyping, SALK_065311 was subjected to similar LatB hypersensitivity and growth assays as hlb2 as mentioned above. Allelism was determined by examining the F1 progeny from a cross between hlb2 × SALK_065311. Following the nomenclature of Steffens et al. (2015) , SALK_065311 and hlb2 were named spi-3 and spi-5 , respectively. Generation of fluorescent protein-tagged constructs and plant lines The SPI protein was tagged at the C-terminus with the fluorescent protein 3x-YPet via the recombineering method ( Zhou et al., 2011 ). Agrobacterium tumefaciens UIA143 pMP90 harboring a SPI-YPet recombineering construct was used to transform the spi-5 mutant by the floral dip method ( Clough and Bent, 1998 ). Transgenic lines were isolated based on resistance to kanamycin and restoration of the wild-type root length. The SPI-YPet transgene was amplified with primers (5′-ATTCCACAAGCAACCAGTCAC-3′ and 5′-AACAGAGTTGAGAGTGGCTCG-3′) and sequenced to confirm the correct configuration. Final validation of SPI-YPet expression was accomplished by screening selected lines under the confocal microscope for YPet fluorescence and complementation of the short root hair phenotype. SCAR2-mCherry lines were also generated by recombineering in which an mCherry tag was fused to an internal region of SCAR2 ( Sharan et al., 2009 ). The mCherry tag was inserted after amino acid 585 in SCAR2 to generate SCAR2-i2mCherry. Recombineering primers were designed as follows: the forward primer contained 50 SCAR2 nucleotides upstream from the insertion site of SCAR2 and 18 nucleotides of the 5′-end of the mCherry cassette, which had a 5× Glycine, 1 Alanine linker. The reverse primer contained 50 nucleotides after the insert site of SCAR2 and 24 nucleotides of the 3′-end of the mCherry cassette. The JAtY75L14 clone was transformed into the recombineering competent Escherichia coli strain SW105 and recombined with the SCAR2-i2mCherry recombineering cassettes. A flippase recombination reaction removed the ampicillin resistance marker. The sequence between the two test primers was verified by DNA sequencing. The clones were transformed into Agrobacterium and then into scar1234 plants ( Dyachok et al., 2008 ). Because both scar1234 plants and the recombineering clones were Basta resistant, plants on MS plates were screened by eye for rescued trichome phenotypes. Rescued plants were genotyped with the recombineering test primers and screened for fluorescence under a confocal microscope. The BRK1promoter: BRK1-YFP introduced into the brk1-1 mutant and ARPC5-GFP are described in Dyachok et al. (2008) and Yanagisawa et al. (2015) , respectively. For the BRK1-mRuby3 construct, the fluorescent protein 3x-mRUBY3 was tagged with a C-terminal linker (10 Alanine, Glycine) using Thermo Fisher Scientific GeneArt to include BamH1 and XbaI sites at its 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. Codon optimization for Arabidopsis was performed on the 3x-mRUBY3 and internal linkers prior to synthesis. The 3X-mRuby3 fragment was inserted as a BamH1/XbaI into the plasmid pBRK:YFPpEZRK ( Dyachok et al., 2008 ).The Agrobacterium floral dip method ( Clough and Bent, 1998 ) was used to transform brk1-2 plants, and transformation was confirmed when this construct fully restored defective brk1-2 trichomes. Plants expressing BRK1-YFP were crossed with spi-5 to generate BRK1-YFP in the spi-5 background. In parallel, plants expressing SPI-YPet were crossed with brk1 to obtain SPI-YPet in the brk1 background. Spi-5 was directly transformed with the UBQ10:mGFP-Lifeact construct by the floral dip method ( Clough and Bent, 1998 ). Spi-5 expressing SEC-RFP was generated by crossing spi-5 with SEC7-RFP -expressing wild-type plants, and progeny in subsequent generations that exhibited fluorescence and the spi root hair phenotypes were selected for analysis. Generation of dual fluorescent protein-labeled plant lines To generate plant lines co-expressing SPI-YPet and BRK1-mRuby3 , SPI-YPet in spi-5 was crossed with BRK1-mRuby3 in the brk1-2 background. Progeny from subsequent generations that exhibited yellow and red fluorescence and rescued root hair and trichome phenotypes were selected for the analysis. For lines expressing SPI-YPet and mRuby3-Lifeact ( Bascom et al., 2018b ), SPI-YPet in the spi-5 background was directly transformed with a UBQ10:Lifeact-mRuby3 construct. Seedlings that showed both YPet and mRuby3 fluorescence were selected under the confocal microscope. Evaluation of root hair growth rate Seeds were surface-sterilized in ethanol and bleach as described above. To evaluate root hair growth rate, seeds were planted on 48 × 64 mm coverslips coated with 0.5× MS, 1% sucrose, and 0.4% (w/v) Gelzan CM (Sigma Aldrich, USA) according to Dyachok et al. (2016) . The coverslips were placed in 9-cm round Petri dishes and the seeds stratified at 4°C for 48 h. After stratification, the coverslip system with planted seed were kept in a 24°C growth chamber under a 14-h light (120 µmol m −2 s −1 )/10-h dark cycle for 5–6 d. To quantify root hair growth rate, time-lapse sequences of elongating root hairs at intervals of 10 min over a period of 60 min from a region of the primary root located between 2 and 3 mm from the root tip were captured with a Nikon Eclipse TE300 inverted microscope using a 10× objective. Root hair lengths at various time points were extracted from digital images using ImageJ (v1.51) software ( https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/ ). The displacement of the root hair tip after each 10-min interval was obtained and divided by 10 to obtain growth rate as µm/min. Chemical treatments of root hairs For BFA treatment, a stock solution of 10 mM was made by dissolving BFA powder (Sigma-Aldrich) in DMSO. Subsequently, the working solution of 50 µM was diluted in 0.5× MS, 1% sucrose solution, and loaded into a 1-mL syringe. The BFA solution was injected directly next to the roots of 4- to 5-d-old Arabidopsis seedlings grown on coverslips and incubated at room temperature for 10 min prior to microscopy. FM 1-43 dye (ThermoFisher Scientific) was dissolved in DMSO to make a 10-mM stock solution. The dye was diluted to 4 µM in 0.5× MS, 1% sucrose solution. The dye was loaded into a 1-mL syringe, and the solution was injected next to the roots as described above. Microscopy and image analysis Live cell imaging of root hairs using confocal microscopy was performed on 4- or 5-d-old seedlings grown on the 48 mm × 64 mm coverslip system described above. Coverslips with seedlings were placed horizontally on the stage of an inverted Leica SP8-X point scanning confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA) or an UltraView ERS spinning-disc confocal microscope (Perkin Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences, Waltham, MA, USA) equipped with 40 × water (numerical aperture = 1.10) or 100 × oil (numerical aperture = 1.40) immersion objectives. SPI-YPet and YFP-BRK1 were imaged by illuminating roots growing along the coverslip surface with the 514 nm line of the SP8-XArgon laser and emission detected at 527 nm. Images of root hairs expressing SCAR2-mCherry, BRK1-mRuby3, Lifeact-mRuby, and SEC7-RFP were acquired by illumination with the tunable SP8-X white light laser (560-580 nm) and detecting emission at 610 nm. Excitation and emission parameters for GFP (GFP-ARPC5 and mGFP-Lifeact) were 488 nm and 510 nm, respectively. Time-lapse movies or single time point images were collected using Volocity acquisition version 6.3.5 (Improvision) or SPX-8 LAS software, for the UltraView and Leica SP8-X, respectively. Quantification of fluorescence from root hair images was conducted on 8-bit confocal images acquired at a single fixed focal plane that spanned the median of the cell (SPI-YPet, BRK1-YFP, SEC-RFP, and BFA and FM 1-43 treatments) or from maximum projected images (mGFP-Lifeact). For SPI-YPet and SEC-RFP, an oval region of interest (ROI) at the root hair tip was drawn and mean fluorescence within this area was acquired using ImageJ. Fluorescence was expressed as the ratio of mean fluorescence within the root tip ROI to background fluorescence. For SPI-YPet, the background used was the region adjacent to but outside of the root hair tip ( Figure 1C ), while for SEC-RFP, the background used was an area on the sub-apical region of the root hair tip ( Figure 2F ). For BRK1-YFP, a ROI was drawn along the apical-most root hair tip that was approximately 20 pixels wide using the selection brush tool of ImageJ. The ratio of fluorescence within this area to background fluorescence was obtained ( Figure 2C ). For BFA, a variable ROI was selected based on the size of BFA-induced agglomerates using the selection brush tool of ImageJ. The ratio of fluorescence was calculated based on similarly sized ROI in the cytoplasmic region. For FM 1-43 experiment, the same quantification technique as for SEC-RFP was used. Root hair growth rate data for scatter plots in Figures 1 and 5 were derived from the same root hair images in which fluorescence images were acquired under a Leica SP8-X. For the former, an image of a root hair was taken at time 0 and every 5 min thereafter. Scatter plots to determine the relationship between growth rate and tip-focused fluorescence were generated in R ( R Core Team, 2019 ) using the ggplot function in the ggplot2 package ( Wickham, 2016 ). Linear regression analysis between two variables was performed using the lme4 package in R software ( Bates et al., 2015 ; R Core Team, 2019 ). Root hair growth rate for Figure 3Q was obtained directly on a Nikon TE300 from root hairs growing in 0.5× MS, 1% sucrose, and 0.4% Gelzan in 5-cm diameter round Petri dishes. Time-lapse images were taken every 10 min over a period of 60 min. The growth rate refers to the displacement of the root hair tip in micrometer divided by time elapsed (min). To quantify tip-focused F-actin, 25 optical sections were taken at 0.5-µm intervals using an UltraView spinning-disc confocal microscope. Raw Ultraview Z-stacks were exported to Imaris image analysis software version 9.2.0 (Bitplane). Transverse sections of the root hair tip were obtained from Z-stacks using the surpass view interface of Imaris software and exported as 8-bit TIFF files. From these images, an ROI spanning the circular area of the root hair tip was drawn using ImageJ and mean fluorescence was extracted ( Figure 3O ). The ratio of the tip fluorescence to background was obtained from 18 to 21 root hairs. Pairwise t tests and ANOVA tests were performed using the lsmeans package ( Lenth, 2016 ) in R ( R Core Team, 2019 ). Violin plots for planar polarity in Figure 5F were designed with the ggplot function in the ggplot2 package ( Wickham, 2016 ). Pairwise Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was selected to compare the shapes of two empirical cumulative distributions for planar polarity of two genotypes using the basic package in R ( R Core Team, 2019 ). Statistical results of t tests and ANOVA are shown in Supplemental Tables S1 and S2 , respectively.

    "results": "Isolation of a new SPIRRIG mutant allele We previously described a forward genetic screen that led to the isolation of three nonallelic recessive Arabidopsis mutants that were hypersensitive to the growth inhibitory effects of LatB. The hypersensitive to LatB1 ( hlb1 ) and hlb3 mutants have been described previously ( Sparks et al., 2016 ; Sun et al., 2019 ). hlb1 was disrupted in a gene encoding a trans-Golgi network-localized tetratricopeptide repeat protein involved in actin-mediated membrane recycling ( Sparks et al., 2016 ), whereas the genetic lesion in hlb3 was found to encode the class II actin nucleator formin ( Sun et al., 2019 ). Here, we report on hlb2 , the third of these recessive mutants. Like hlb1 and hlb3 , primary root growth was more severely inhibited by LatB in hlb2 compared to the wild-type. In the absence of LatB or at low (i.e. 25 nM) LatB concentrations, the primary root length of hlb2 was similar to the wild-type. Differences in root length between wild-type and hlb2 became apparent when seedlings were grown on a concentration of 50-nM LatB and higher ( Supplemental Figure S1, A–C ). Through map-based cloning, we found that the mutation in hlb2 was confined to a region between the AT1G02740 and AT1G03410 loci. Nucleotide sequencing revealed that hlb2 had a 10-base pair deletion (Chr1 position: 720,152–720,161) in exon 14 of the AT1G03060 gene. This 10-base pair deletion led to an open-reading frame shift at the Asp 1526 codon, resulting in a truncated protein ( Supplemental Figure S2A ). AT1G03060 encodes the BEACH domain-containing protein SPI ( Saedler et al., 2009 ; Supplemental Figure S2A ). Because the first spi mutant alleles were reported to have short root hairs ( Saedler et al., 2009 ), we examined root hairs of hlb2 . The growth rate of hlb2 root hairs was approximately 70% slower than the wild-type, with some root hairs forming only small bulges ( Supplemental Figure S2 , B and C). Moreover, hlb2 had mild trichome defects that were reminiscent of the phenotypes of previously isolated spi mutant alleles ( Supplemental Figure S2D ; Saedler et al., 2009 ). To further verify if HLB2 is SPI , we obtained a mutant from the publicly available SALK collection (SALK_065311), which had a T-DNA insertion in the 10th exon of the SPI gene ( Supplemental Figure S2A ; Alonso et al., 2003 ). The SALK_065311 line we obtained is the same as the spi-3 mutant allele reported previously in Steffens et al. (2015) . In addition to having similar root hair and trichome defects to hlb2 , primary roots of spi-3 were hypersensitive to LatB ( Supplemental Figure S2E ), and a cross between hlb2 and SALK_065311 failed to complement each other in the F1 hybrid. Taken together, these results indicate that hlb2 is a new spi mutant allele. Based on earlier nomenclature ( Steffens et al., 2015 ), we renamed hlb2 as spi-5 ( Supplemental Figure S2A ). The spi-5 mutant allele was used for all subsequent experiments. SPIRRIG localizes to the tips of rapidly elongating root hairs SPI fluorescent protein fusions were previously demonstrated to associate with P-bodies and endosomes ( Steffens et al., 2015 , 2017 ). However, these constructs have not been shown to complement the defective root hair and trichome phenotypes of spi . Due to the large size of SPI, we were unable to generate native promoter-driven fluorescent protein fusions to the full-length SPI complementary DNA or genomic DNA. To overcome this problem, SPI was tagged with the 3x-Yellow Fluorescent Protein ( Y F P ) for e nergy t ransfer (YPet; Nguyen and Daugherty, 2005 ) using a method called recombineering. This method involves tagging the gene of interest in the context of transformation-competent bacterial artificial chromosomes to ensure that all regulatory sequences are included in the fluorescent protein fusion ( Zhou et al., 2011 ; Brumos et al., 2020 ). Once spi was transformed with a recombineered SPI-YPet construct, primary root hypersensitivity to LatB, short root hairs, and defective trichome phenotypes were rescued, indicating that the construct was functional ( Figure 1A; Supplemental Figure S3 ). Transgenic complementation of spi with SPI-YPet provided additional evidence that HLB2 is SPI . Confocal microscopy of more than 150 root hairs from at least 25 seedlings revealed that SPI-YPet signal was strongest in the tips of rapidly elongating root hairs ( Figure 1, B and C ; ( Supplemental Movies S1 and S2 ). Low magnification time-lapse movies showed that 100% of rapidly elongating root hairs had robust SPI-YPet signal at the tips ( Supplemental Movie S1 ). Weak or no SPI-YPet fluorescence was detected at the RHID and during early root hair bulge formation, but the signal intensified as the root hairs transitioned to tip growth ( Figure 1C; Supplemental Movie S3 ). SPI-YPet signal dissipated as the root hairs matured and the tip growth rate declined ( Figure 1, B and C ; Supplemental Movie S4 ). A linear regression analysis showed that the intensity of SPI-YPet fluorescence in root hair tips is significantly positively correlated to rapid root hair growth ( Figure 1D ). These results indicate that the SPI protein has functions related to root hair elongation, which is consistent with the short root hair phenotypes of spi . Figure 1.

Faint SPI-YPet signal is found in bulging root hairs or those that have stopped elongating (arrowheads). Images are representative of approximately 150 root hairs from at least 25 seedlings. Bar = 10 µm. D, Scatter plot showing correlation analysis of root hair tip SPI-YPet fluorescence and root hair tip growth. The mean fluorescence in the oval in region 1 divided by the oval in region 2 as shown in (C) represents the fluorescence ratio in the Y -axis. Line shows linear regression fit with R 2 value = 0.308 and P = 1.72 × 10 −5 ( n =5–7 root hairs per time point) SPIRRIG is transported to the root hair tip via post-Golgi compartments The prominent SPI-YPet signal at the tips of elongating root hairs is reminiscent of the localization patterns of post-Golgi markers such as RAB small GTPases, which are known to function in tip-directed secretion ( Preuss et al., 2004 ). We therefore hypothesized that SPI is trafficked to the tips of root hairs via post-Golgi compartments. To test this hypothesis, we treated seedlings expressing SPI-YPet with Brefeldin A (BFA). BFA is a fungal toxin that is routinely used to investigate endomembrane dynamics because it prevents vesicle formation for exocytosis by inhibiting ADP ribosylation factor GEFs (ARF-GEFs), while still enabling endocytosis and some retrograde pathways to continue ( Baluška, 2002 , Doyle et al., 2015 ). In Arabidopsis roots, BFA binds to the ARF-GEF GNOM, which is localized to early endosomes in the endocytic pathway, and possibly also in the trans-Golgi network (TGN; Robinson et al., 2008 ). Consequently, BFA treatment in Arabidopsis roots causes the formation of TGN/endosomal agglomerations called BFA-induced compartments. Treatment of seedlings expressing SPI-YPet with 50-µM BFA induced the formation of SPI-YPet agglomerates in root hairs ( Figure 2, A –C). The average number of BFA-induced compartments per root hair was 3.69 ± 4.05 ( sd ). We also quantified the effect of BFA by obtaining the fluorescence ratio of the SPI-YPet agglomerates to the fluorescence of the root hair cytoplasm that did not contain any agglomerates ( Figure 2D , inset). The higher fluorescence ratio of BFA-treated root hairs compared to untreated controls reinforces our qualitative observations of the sensitivity of SPI-YPet to BFA ( Figure 2D ). The appearance of fluorescent puncta at the shank of root hairs also suggests that SPI-YPet is trafficked to the tip via post-Golgi compartments ( Supplemental Movies S2–S4 ). These results indicate that SPI-YPet is associated with endomembranes and is trafficked to the root hair tips via BFA-sensitive post-Golgi compartments. Figure 2. Open in a new tab SPI-YPet is localized to BFA-sensitive post-Golgi compartments. A, B, Low-magnification images showing several root hairs expressing SPI-YPet.

C, Bright field and corresponding fluorescence image of representative untreated and BFA-treated elongating root hair showing the accumulation of SPI-YPet at the apical dome in solvent control-treated seedlings (arrow).

D, Box plot of BFA-induced agglomerates of SPI-YPet in untreated control root hairs and after treatment with 50-µM BFA. Ratio values were obtained by dividing mean fluorescence in rectangular region in 1 over region 2 (inset).

Each dot represents individual measurements from 8 to 14 root hairs per group from 8 to 24 plants. *** P <0.001 indicates statistical significance as determined by Student’s t test. BFA-treated plants had an average of 3.7 BFA-induced agglomerates per root hair, with standard deviation of 4.05, whereas control root hairs showed no BFA-induced agglomerates per root hair.

F, Box plot of SEC-RFP root hair tip accumulation expressed as fluorescence ratio. Ratio values were obtained by dividing mean fluorescence in oval region in 1 over region 2 (inset). Box limits indicate 25th and 75th percentiles, horizontal line is the median and whiskers display minimum and maximum values. *** P <0.001 indicates statistical significance as determined by Student’s t test. Each dot represents individual measurement from 8 to 10 root hairs per group from 9 to 12 plants The slow root hair growth of spi and the formation of SPI-YPet agglomerates after BFA treatment suggest that spi may be defective in tip-directed protein secretion, which would partly explain the short root hair phenotypes of spi . To address this question, we expressed the secreted (SEC)-red fluorescent protein (RFP), which contains a cleavable sporamin signal peptide that accumulates in the apoplast ( Faso et al., 2009 ), and observed changes in endocytosis using the membrane selective dye FM 1–43 in both spi and wild-type genotypes ( Bolte et al., 2004 ; Jelínková et al., 2010 ; Malínská et al., 2014 ). Similar to previous reports, rapidly elongating wild-type root hairs had a tip-focused gradient of SEC-RFP ( Sparks et al., 2016 ; Figure 2E ). In contrast, slow-growing root hairs of spi lacked these tip-focused SEC-RFP gradients ( Figure 2E ). We quantified tip-focused SEC-RFP in elongating wild-type and spi root hairs by obtaining the ratio of tip fluorescence to the subapical cytoplasm ( Figure 2F , inset). The lower fluorescence ratio of spi root hairs compared to the wild-type confirmed our qualitative observations ( Figure 2F ). These results were corroborated by examining FM 1-43 dye uptake. spi root hairs showed a significantly reduced tip-focused FM 1-43 gradient compared to the wild-type ( Supplemental Figure S4, A–C ). Altogether, the loss of tip-focused secretion indicated that the spi mutants had defects in tip-directed bulk flow exocytosis. SPIRRIG maintains root hair tip-focused F-actin In a study of other spi mutant alleles, the similarities in phenotypes among spi , w/sc , and arp2/3 mutants suggested that SPI could function in actin-dependent cellular processes ( Saedler et al., 2009 ). However, because the trichome defects of spi were mild compared to other w/sc and arp2/3 mutants, no obvious actin phenotypes were observed in spi trichomes ( Schwab et al., 2003 ). To clarify the relationship between SPI and actin, we focused on investigating actin organization in root hairs, since these structures displayed the most obvious growth defects in SPI -altered plants. To study actin organization, we expressed the live F-actin reporter UBQ10: mGFP-Lifeact in spi ( Vidali et al., 2010 ). This particular F-actin reporter was selected because it prominently labels the tip-focused F-actin meshwork typically observed in root hairs that are rapidly growing ( Sparks et al., 2016 ). In the wild-type, fine F-actin networks were observed in the root hair bulge, which had a weaker signal compared to the thicker actin bundles in other regions of the trichoblast ( Figure 3A ). As the root hair bulge expanded and the root hair transitioned to rapid tip growth, the tip-focused F-actin meshwork, which consisted of short filaments and dynamic puncta, became more conspicuous ( Figure 3, B–E ; Supplemental Movie S5 ; Sparks et al., 2016 )). When wild-type root hairs stopped elongating, the tip-focused F-actin meshwork was replaced by thick F-actin cables ( Figure 3F ). Figure 3. Open in a new tab The tip-focused F-actin meshwork is disrupted in root hairs of spi . A–D, Time course of F-actin organization in a wild-type root hair from bulge formation to rapid tip growth. Weakly fluorescing F-actin networks (double asterisks) in the root hair bulge (A) reorganize into prominent tip-focused meshworks as the root hair transitions to rapid tip growth (arrows in B–D). E, Tip-focused F-actin meshworks (arrow) remain prominent in a long, rapidly elongating wild-type root hair. F, Tip-focused F-actin meshworks in wild-type root hairs are replaced with F-actin bundles (arrowheads) that protrude to the tip when growth stops. G–J, Time course of F-actin organization in a spi root hair bulge that is unable to transition to tip growth. Distinct F-actin meshworks are unable to form in root hair bulges that terminate tip growth (double asterisks, I). Thick F-actin bundles eventually form in these short, nongrowing root hair bulges (arrowhead, J). K–N, F-actin organization in slow-growing spi root hairs. Some spi root hairs show the tip-focused F-actin meshworks typically observed in the wild-type (arrow, K, L). However, tip-focused F-actin meshworks in slow-growing spi root hairs either dissipate (double asterisks, M) or prematurely form thick F-actin bundles that protrude to the tip (arrow, N). Images from (A) to (N) are based on maximum projection images of 20–25 optical sections taken at 0.5-µm intervals. O, Representative maximum projection images and corresponding computer-generated cross-sections of wild-type and spi root hair tips. Only growing root hairs with a clear cytoplasmic cap were selected for analysis. The fluorescence ratio of the root hair tip (oval in 1) to background (oval in 2) was used to quantify tip-focused F-actin meshworks. P, Box plot showing tip-focused F-actin fluorescence ratio.

Each dot represents individual measurement from four to five root hairs per group from one to two plants. All scale bars = 10 µm F-actin organization in the tips of spi root hairs was different from that of the wild-type. As noted, some root hairs of spi were only able to form small bulges due to premature termination of tip-growth ( Supplemental Figure S2 ). In spi root hairs, the distinct F-actin meshwork observed in wild-type root hairs was unable to form. Instead, F-actin in these spi root hair bulges contained thick F-actin cables that resembled those of wild-type root hairs that had terminated growth ( Figure 3, G and H ). However, the thick F-actin cables in nongrowing spi root hair bulges were unstable, as they dissipated ( Figure 3I ) and reformed again at a later time ( Figure 3J ). In the small population of spi root hairs that were able to undergo tip growth, a few exhibited a tip-focused F-actin meshwork that resembled those observed in elongating wild-type root hairs ( Figure 3K ). However, most of these slow-growing spi root hairs lacked a tip-focused F-actin meshwork ( Figure 3, L and M ; Supplemental Movie S5 ) or had thick F-actin bundles protruding to the tip, a feature that was reminiscent of nongrowing, mature wild-type root hairs ( Figure 3N ). We quantified the disruption of the tip-focused F-actin meshwork in spi by measuring F-actin fluorescence from computer-reconstructed transverse sections of the root hair tip and by taking the ratio of the average fluorescence over background signal. A higher ratio indicates a higher signal of tip-focused F-actin ( Figure 3O ). Our analysis showed that the fluorescence ratio in spi root hairs was significantly reduced compared to the wild-type root hairs, supporting visual observations that the tip-focused F-actin meshwork in spi root hairs is disrupted ( Figure 3P ). To ensure that the mGFP-Lifectact probe did not interfere with normal root hair elongation or F-actin organization, we compared the growth rates of the wild-type and spi with and without the reporter. The root hair growth rates of wild-type root hairs without the mGFP-Lifeact probe were not significantly different from that of wild-type root hairs expressing the reporter. Similarly, the growth rate of spi expressing mGFP-Lifectact was not significantly different from that of spi without the reporter ( Figure 3Q ). We generated plants expressing both SPI-YPet and mRuby-Lifeact to examine the correlation between SPI and F-actin in growing root hairs. In elongating root hairs of dual labeled seedlings, SPI-YPet and the mRuby-labeled F-actin meshwork overlapped at the tips of actively elongating root hairs ( Figure 4A; Supplemental Movie S6 ). In one time-lapse sequence, when the root hair stopped growing at the 80–120 min time points, both SPI-YPet and mRuby-labeled F-actin meshwork dissipated from the root tip ( Figure 4A ). Quantification of both SPI-YPet and mRuby-Lifeact from at least three root hair time-lapse sequences revealed that the appearances of both markers at the tip were highly correlated to each other ( Figure 4, B and C ). This supports the notion that root hair tip-localized SPI is strongly associated with the tip-focused F-actin meshwork, and as such is involved in sustaining normal root hair elongation in coordination with actin. Figure 4. Open in a new tab SPI-YPet and mRuby-Lifeact co-localizes at the root tip in elongating root hairs. A, Time course of a root hair simultaneously expressing SPI-YPet and mRuby-Lifeact. Note that SPI-positive post-Golgi compartments and F-actin meshworks colocalized at the root hair apex (arrows) and dissipated at around the same time (arrowheads) at 80 min. Images are single median optical sections. Bars = 10 µm. B, Method for obtaining SPI-YPet and mRuby-Lifeact ratios at the root hair tip for data shown in (C). A rectangular ROI at the tip and sub apex was used to measure fluorescence. C, Scatter plot showing correlation analysis of root hair tip mRuby-Lifeact fluorescence and SPI-YPet fluorescence within the same root hair. The mean fluorescence in the rectangle in region 1 divided by the rectangle in region 2 as shown in (C) represents the fluorescence ratio for each reporter. For each ratio value, root hair growth rate was obtained by measuring the displacement of the root hair tip after a 10 min interval. Line shows linear regression fit with R 2 value = 0.725 and P = 2.127 × 10 −8 ( n = 26 time points from three root hair sequences) BRK1 and SCAR2 are molecular determinants of the root hair initiation domain The identification of SPI as one of the genes in the DIS group that also included genes encoding subunits of the W/SC and ARP2/3 complexes ( Saedler et al., 2009 ) raises the possibility that SPI might function in root hair developmental pathways mediated by W/SC-ARP2/3. Furthermore, the observation that SPI-YPET accumulation at the root hair tip ( Figure 1 ) mirrors the enrichment of BRK1-YFP and ARPC4-GFP at the apex of Physcomitrium protonemal cells ( Perroud and Quatrano, 2006 , 2008 ) raises the possibility that the W/SC and ARP2/3 complexes are localized to the root hair. In an attempt to link SPI with the W/SC and ARP2/3 pathways, we imaged roots of brk1 complemented with BRK1promoter:BRK1-YFP (hereafter referred to as BRK1-YFP; Figure 5, A–C; Dyachok et al., 2008 ). Unlike SPI-YPet, we did not observe a BRK1-YFP fluorescence gradient in rapidly elongating root hairs. However, closer examination of trichoblasts revealed prominent BRK1-YFP signal at the plasma membrane of the RHID that mirrored the localization of other known early root hair initiation site markers such as ROP ( Figure 5A ). Unlike ROP, which has a persistent plasma membrane localization throughout root hair development ( Molendijk et al., 2001 ; Jones et al., 2002 ), BRK1-YFP signal was transient and dissipated as root hairs transitioned to rapid tip growth ( Figure 5B; Supplemental Movie S7 ). This observation was in contrast to the intensification of SPI-YPet fluorescence as root hairs proceeded with rapid tip growth (see Figure 1 ). In agreement with our visual observations, a linear regression analysis showed that BRK1-YFP fluorescence is inversely proportional to the root hair growth rate ( Figure 5C ). Figure 5. Open in a new tab BRK1 and SCAR2 mark the root hair initiation domain and contribute to planar polarity. A, Maximum projection confocal micrograph of the elongation and maturation zone of an Arabidopsis primary root expressing a functional BRK1-YFP fusion.

B, Time course of BRK1-YFP depletion in a developing root hair. BRK1-YFP signal (arrows) is strongest prior to the formation of a root hair bulge (0 min) and gradually dissipates (arrowheads) as the root hair undergoes rapid tip growth (35–50 min). Bar = 20 µm. C, A scatter plot showing an inverse relationship between BRK1-YFP signal and root hair growth rate. Ratio of fluorescence of BRK1-YFP (a) to background (b) (inset) was plotted against root hair growth rate. Line shows linear regression fit with R 2 value = 0.2667 and P = 1.131 × 10 −7 ( n = 5–7 root hairs per time point). D, Time course of SCAR2-mCherry in a developing root hair. Like BRK1-YFP, SCAR2-mCherry signal is strongest at the RHID and early stages of root hair bulge formation (0 min, arrow). SCAR2-mCherry signal dissipates when the root hair undergoes rapid tip growth (40 min, arrowhead). Bar = 20 µm. E, Brightfield microscopy images of representative trichoblasts from 6-d-old seedlings showing apical shift in root hair position of brk1 compared to the wild-type, and complementation of brk1 planar polarity phenotypes by BRK1-YFP.

F, Violin plots of root hair planar polarity in wild-type, brk1 , scar1234 , BRK1-YFP in brk1 , SCAR2-mCherry in scar1234 , arp2 , arp3 , and arpc5 genotypes. Relative root hair position was obtained by taking the ratio of the distance from the basal trichoblast wall (bottom arrowheads in E) to the basal root hair wall asterisks over the total length of the trichoblasts (i.e. length between the two arrowsheads).

To address this question, we imaged a recombineered SCAR2-mCherry fusion expressed in the scar1 scar2 scar3 scar4 ( scar1234 ) quadruple mutant background. Like BRK1-YFP, SCAR2-mCherry marked the RHID and dissipated when rapid root hair tip growth commenced ( Figure 5D ). The accumulation of BRK1-YFP and SCAR2-mCherry at the RHID led us to hypothesize that brk1 and scar1234 might have defects in root hair initiation. One parameter that has been studied extensively as an indicator of root hair initiation defects is planar polarity, which is a measure of root hair position along the length of the trichoblast ( Nakamura and Grebe, 2018 ). We found that the root hair positions of brk1 and scar1234 shifted apically (i.e. toward the shoot) compared to the wild-type ( Figure 5F ). The planar polarity defects of brk1 were rescued by expressing BRK1-YFP in brk1 , while partial complementation of scar1234 was achieved by expressing SCAR2-mCherry in scar1234 ( Figure 5F ). We also investigated if the ARP2/3 pathway was involved in RHID, since the W/SC complex can interact with the ARP2/3 pathway. APR2/3 subunit mutants arp2, arp3 , and arpc5 exhibited significantly apically shifted root hairs that were similar to those of brk1 and scar1234 ( Figure 5F ). Nonetheless, we did not observe polarized accumulation of ARPC5-GFP at the RHID or at root hair tips ( Supplemental Figure S5 ). These results suggest that the ARP2/3 pathway may interact with the W/SC complex at the RHID but is not essential for root hair positioning. Taken together, our results reveal that BRK1 and SCAR2 are molecular determinants of the RHID that are required for specifying the position of root hair emergence and can do so in both an ARP2/3-dependent and -independent manner. SPI is required for the depletion of BRK1 as root hairs transition to tip growth Live cell microscopy of BRK1-YFP and SPI-YPet revealed contrasting spatial and temporal dynamics, with the former intensifying and the latter dissipating as root hairs elongated ( Figures 1 and 5 ). To observe BRK1 and SPI simultaneously within the same root hair, we generated plants expressing both SPI-YPet and BRK1-mRuby3 . Similar to BRK1-YFP, BRK1-mRuby3 labeled the RHID and dissipated as the root hair bulge expanded ( Figure 6A ). Within the same root hair cell, SPI-YPet fluorescence at the tip intensified as BRK1-mRuby3 dissipated ( Figure 6A; Supplemental Movie S8 ). To better understand the relationship between SPI and BRK1, we expressed BRK1-YFP in spi and SPI-YPet in brk1 . Unlike BRK1-YFP in the complemented brk1 background ( Figure 5B ), BRK1-YFP signal in spi persisted throughout the entire imaging time course ( Figure 6B ). In several cases, BRK1-YFP remained visible in nongrowing root hair bulges of spi for more than 60 min. The persistence of BRK1-YFP signal was also observed in short root hair outgrowths of spi ( Figure 6C; Supplemental Movie S9 ). To support our visual observations with quantitative data, we selected root hairs of spi and brk1 expressing BRK1-YFP that were of approximately equal lengths. From these root hairs, the ratio of BRK1-YFP tip fluorescence to subapical fluorescence was obtained ( Figure 6D ). These analyses showed that BRK1-YFP signal persisted in spi , as demonstrated by the higher fluorescence ratio ( Figure 6E ). In contrast, BRK1-YFP in brk1 root hairs disappeared from RHID when root hairs experienced rapid tip growth and thus did not exhibit a fluorescence gradient at the root tips ( Figure 6, D and E ). In addition, SPI-YPet in brk1 exhibited similar dynamics to SPI-YPet in the complemented spi ( Figure 6F ). In brk1 , SPI-YPet signal was weak during early root hair bulge formation and intensified as root hair tip growth accelerated ( Figure 6F ). Taken together, these results strongly indicate that SPI contributes to the stability of BRK1 during the transition from root hair initiation to rapid tip growth. On the other hand, BRK1 does not appear to have direct effects on SPI during root hair initiation or rapid tip growth. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Depletion of BRK1 as root hairs transition to tip growth is delayed in spi. A, Dual imaging of BRK1-mRuby3 (arrowheads) and SPI-YPet shows that dissipation of BRK1 coincides with accumulation of SPI (arrow) as root hairs transition to rapid tip growth. Bar = 20 µm. B and C, BRK1-YFP signal persists in spi root hair bulges (arrows in B) that fail to transition to tip growth and in slow-growing spi root hairs (arrows in C). Bars = 20 µm. D, Method for quantification of BRK1-YFP signal persistence in the root tip of spi . Root hairs of brk1 and spi expressing BRK1-YFP that were approximately 40 µm in length were selected. Rectangular ROIs (1 and 2) were drawn to obtain fluorescence values. Ratio values were obtained by dividing mean fluorescence in rectangle region 1 over region 2 used to plot data in (E).
