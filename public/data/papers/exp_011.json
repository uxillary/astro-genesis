    "abstract": "Background The dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC) is located at the sarcolemma of muscle fibers, providing structural integrity. Mutations in and loss of DGC proteins cause a spectrum of muscular dystrophies. When only the sarcoglycan subcomplex is absent, muscles display severe myofiber degeneration, but little susceptibility to contractile damage, suggesting that disease occurs not by structural deficits but through aberrant signaling, namely, loss of normal mechanotransduction signaling through the sarcoglycan complex. We extended our previous studies on mechanosensitive, γ-sarcoglycan-dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation, to determine whether additional pathways are altered with the loss of γ-sarcoglycan. Methods We examined mechanotransduction in the presence and absence of γ-sarcoglycan, using C2C12 myotubes, and primary cultures and isolated muscles from C57Bl/6 (C57) and γ-sarcoglycan-null (γ-SG -/- ) mice. All were subjected to cyclic passive stretch. Signaling protein phosphorylation was determined by immunoblotting of lysates from stretched and non-stretched samples. Calcium dependence was assessed by maintaining muscles in calcium-free or tetracaine-supplemented Ringer’s solution. Dependence on mTOR was determined by stretching isolated muscles in the presence or absence of rapamycin. Results C2C12 myotube stretch caused a robust increase in P-p70S6K, but decreased P-FAK and P-ERK2. Neither Akt nor ERK1 were responsive to passive stretch. Similar but non-significant trends were observed in C57 primary cultures in response to stretch, and γ-SG -/- cultures displayed no p70S6K response. In contrast, in isolated muscles, p70S6K was mechanically responsive. Basal p70S6K activation was elevated in muscles of γ-SG -/- mice, in a calcium-independent manner. p70S6K activation increased with stretch in both C57 and γ-SG -/- isolated muscles, and was sustained in γ-SG -/- muscles, unlike the transient response in C57 muscles. Rapamycin treatment blocked all of p70S6K activation in stretched C57 muscles, and reduced downstream S6RP phosphorylation. However, even though rapamycin treatment decreased p70S6K activation in stretched γ-SG -/- muscles, S6RP phosphorylation remained elevated. Conclusions p70S6K is an important component of γ-sarcoglycan-dependent mechanotransduction in skeletal muscle. Our results suggest that loss of γ-sarcoglycan uncouples the response of p70S6K to stretch and implies that γ-sarcoglycan is important for inactivation of this pathway. Overall, we assert that altered load-sensing mechanisms exist in muscular dystrophies where the sarcoglycans are absent.

  "ai_summary": "This study investigates the role of γ-sarcoglycan in mechanotransduction signaling within skeletal muscle, particularly focusing on p70S6 kinase (p70S6K) responses to mechanical stretch. The research highlights that the absence of γ-sarcoglycan, a component of the dystrophin glycoprotein complex, leads to significant alterations in signaling pathways that are crucial for muscle function. Using C2C12 myotubes and muscle samples from both wild-type and γ-sarcoglycan-null mice, the authors found that stretching induced a robust activation of p70S6K in normal muscle, whereas this response was absent in γ-sarcoglycan-null samples. Notably, while p70S6K activation was calcium-independent in γ-sarcoglycan-null muscles, it remained elevated even under conditions that typically reduce its activation. These findings suggest that γ-sarcoglycan is essential for the normal mechanotransduction response, and its absence disrupts load-sensing mechanisms, potentially contributing to the pathophysiology of muscular dystrophies. This research has implications for understanding muscle degeneration and developing targeted therapies in space biosciences and beyond.",
