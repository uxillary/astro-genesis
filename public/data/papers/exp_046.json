    "abstract": "The bacterial mechanosensitive channel of large conductance, MscL, is one of the best characterized mechanosensitive channels serving as a paradigm for how proteins can sense and transduce mechanical forces. The physiological role of MscL is that of an emergency release valve that opens a large pore upon a sudden drop in the osmolarity of the environment. A crystal structure of a closed state of MscL shows it as a homopentamer, with each subunit consisting of two transmembrane domains (TM). There is consensus that the TM helices move in an iris like manner tilting in the plane of the membrane while gating. An N-terminal amphipathic helix that lies along the cytoplasmic membrane (S1), and the portion of TM2 near the cytoplasmic interface (TM2 ci ), are relatively close in the crystal structure, yet predicted to be dynamic upon gating. Here we determine how these two regions interact in the channel complex, and study how these interactions change as the channel opens. We have screened 143 double-cysteine mutants of E. coli MscL for their efficiency in disulfide bridging and generated a map of protein-protein interactions between these two regions. Interesting candidates have been further studied by patch clamp and show differences in channel activity under different redox potentials; the results suggest a model for the dynamics of these two domains during MscL gating.

    "methods": "Strains and cell growth E. coli strain PB104 ( ΔmscL::Cm ) 30 was used as host for the pB10 expression constructs. 14 , 30 - 32 PB104 was used for the in vivo cysteine trapping experiments and for the generation of spheroplasts for electrophysiological analysis. Cultures were routinely grown in Lennox Broth (LB) media (Fisher Scientific) plus ampicillin (100 mg/ml) in a shaker-incubator at 37°C and rotated at 250 cpm. Expression was induced by addition of 1 mM isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) (Anatrace). Generations of mutants Single mutants were generated using the mega primer technique as described. 9 The double mutants were generated by digesting with restriction enzymes NsiI and BamHI, which separate the DNA encoding TM1 from that encoding TM2. The two fragments encoding the cysteine mutations were then ligated to generate the insert encoding the double cysteine mutants. In Vivo Disulfide Trapping Overnight cultures were diluted 1:100 and grown 1 h at 37°C in LB + ampicillin (approximately 410mOsmolar). LB with 1 M NaCl was then added for a final concentration of 0.5 M. Cultures were then induced with 1 mM IPTG for 1 h when an OD 600 of 0.2 was reached. Cultures were either Mock shocked (0.5 M NaCl LB) or shocked (water with 1.5 µM copper-phenanthroline) at a 1:20 dilution for 15 min at 37°C. Samples were pelleted at 4,000 g for 20 min and immediately resuspended in non-reducing sample buffer, adjusted for final OD, and run on a Criterion 4–20% gel (Bio-Rad) for western blot analysis. 17 Note that in less than 5 min the samples are collected and loaded on the gel. Gels were run at 200 V for 55 min. and transferred to PVDF Immobilon-P (Millipore) in Tris-Glycine, 15% methanol and 0.01% SDS for 70 min. at 110V. After blocking, the primary antibody, anti- MscL was diluted to 1:15,000 and incubated overnight at 4°C. After washing, the secondary antibody, goat anti rabbit HRP (Bio-Rad), was diluted to 1:100,000 and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The blot was then washed and developed with Millipore HRP substrate for 5 min and exposed to film. Disulfide trapping quantification The density of the bands was measured with Scion Image software (Scion Corporation). The bands in each lane were measured as two sets, monomer and dimer, and trimers to pentamers (multimers). The values are expressed as the percentage of total protein existing as multimers. Electrophysiology E. coli giant spheroplasts were generated and used in patch-clamp experiments as described previously. 33 Excised, inside-out patches were examined at room temperature under symmetrical conditions using a buffer containing 200mM KCl, 90mM MgCl2, 10mM CaCl2, and 5mM HEPES pH 6 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). To study redox effects in channel activity H 2 O 2 1–3% v/v or dithiothreitol (DTT) 1–10 mM (Sigma) were added to the bath. A previous study has demonstrated that this treatment has no detrimental effect on channel function. 34 Recordings were performed at -20 mV (positive pipette). Data were acquired at a sampling rate of 20 kHz with a 5-kHz filter using an AxoPatch 200B amplifier in conjunction with Axoscope software (Axon Instruments). A piezoelectric pressure transducer (World Precision Instruments) was used to monitor the pressure throughout the experiments. Data were analyzed using Clampfit9 from pClamp9 software (Axon Instruments).",
    "results": "In this work we study protein-protein interactions between S1 (S2-M12) and TM2 ci (F93-K105) residues in E. coli MscL channel ( Fig. 1 ) by using an in vivo disulfide trapping assay. 17 We chose to perform this in vivo assay because it involves little or no manipulation of the protein and is therefore more likely to reflect real protein-protein interactions, eliminating possible artifacts occurring during protein purification. Briefly, bacteria expressing each double mutant were grown in high salt media and either diluted in media of the same osmolarity (control) or lower osmolarity (osmotic down-shock) with the oxidizing agent copper-phenanthroline. After a brief incubation the bacteria were pelleted, resuspended in sample buffer, run in an electrophoresis gel and visualized in a western blot with a MscL antibody. Interestingly, we found that interactions between S1 and TM2 ci domains are so efficient that only 1.5 µM copper-phenanthroline had to be used in order not to saturate the screen. To compare the likelihood of interactions between cysteine substituted residues from S1 and TM2 ci domains, we measured the amount of protein existing as monomer through pentamers in western blots. We expressed the values as the percentage of multimers vs. the total protein. For the multimer value we counted only the trimers to pentamers because some single cysteine mutants in S1 can form dimers, 15 thus leading to ambiguity. The 3D graph in Figure 2 summarizes our results. The X and Y axis are the residues from S1 (residues 2 to 12) and TM2 ci (residues 93 to 105) regions respectively, and the z axis reflects the percentage of total protein existing as multimers for each double cysteine mutant. Note that the graph shows a pattern where almost no multimer formation occurs between S1 and residues A95, M94 and F93, residues that are inside the membrane of TM2, while the strongest interactions occur between K105 to L102 and S1. Open in a new tab Figure 2. Interactions between cytoplasmic domains. The graph summarizes the results of the in vivo disulfide trapping experiments and compares the efficiency of multimer formation between 143 MscL double cysteine mutants. The y and x axis reflect the sequence of amino acids of the S1 (residues 2 to 12) and TM2 ci (residues 93 to 105) regions respectively and the z axis reflects the percentage of total protein existing as multimers for each double cysteine mutant. The legend shows the color corresponding to each percentage value. All values represent the mean of at least three repeats. The double mutant M12C/N103C showed one of the higher values in multimer formation. These residues are predicted to interact in the closed MscL, and as can be seen in the western blot, the mutated protein exists exclusively as a pentamer after treatment with oxidizer (Fig. Three A, B). Furthermore, M12C/N103C single channel activity could only be seen after treatment with the reducing agent DTT, and the activity disappeared when oxidizer was added to the bath ( Fig. 3C ). These results are consistent with M12C/N103C MscL being locked in a closed conformation when disulfide bridging occurs. Open in a new tab Figure 3. Bridging M12C/N103C mutant locks the channel in a closed state ( A ). The scheme shows the corresponding position of the cysteine substituted residues M12 (red) and N103 (blue) in MscL M. tuberculosis structure, which reflects a nearly closed state. The insert is an amplification of the detail inside the square to show how close these two residues are predicted to be. ( B ) Western blot of M12C/N103C MscL derived from cells non-shocked (NS, left lane) or down-shocked in presence of 1.5 µM of the oxidizer copper-phenanthroline (S, right lane). Note that the protein derived from the shocked cells exists almost exclusively as a pentamer (97% of total protein). ( C ) Patch clamp analysis of M12C/N103C MscL in giant spheroplasts shows differential activities under different redox conditions. The traces show the M12C/N103C MscL channel activity elicited by applying negative pressure to the patch (in mmHg, below the traces). After adding the reducing agent DTT to the bath (upper trace), channel activity could be observed; but after washing the DTT from the bath and adding peroxide (lower trace) the channels were locked closed and could not be activated even at higher negative pressures. On the other side of the graph, one of the peaks reflecting multimerization is I3C/I96C. These residues are not predicted to interact in the closed structure of MscL, but still show that more than 50% of the protein in the western blot is forming multimers (Fig. Four A, B). Patch clamp experiments show that I3C/I96C single channel activity can be elicited both in the presence of reducing or oxidizing agents in the bath ( Fig. 4C ). Interestingly, a more detailed analysis of the amplitude of the channel in different redox conditions showed that in the presence of the oxidizer the channel is stabilized in a sub-conductive state (Fig. Four C, D). Open in a new tab Figure 4. Bridging I3C/I96C locks the channel into a sub-conducting state. ( A ) The scheme shows the corresponding position of the cysteine substituted residues I3 (red) and I96 (blue) in MscL M. tuberculosis structure. The insert is an amplification of the detail inside the square to show that I3 and I96 are not predicted to interact with each other in the closed MscL channel. ( B ) Western blot of I3C/I96C MscL derived from cells non-shocked (NS, left lane) or down-shocked in presence of 1.5 µM of the oxidizer copper-phenanthroline (S, right lane). Note that the protein derived from the shocked cells exists in multiple states from dimmers to pentamers, with multimers (3X to 5X) representing 54% of total protein. ( C ) Patch clamp analysis of I3C/I96C MscL in giant spheroplasts shows that the channel locks in a sub-conductive stated under oxidizing conditions. The traces show the I3C/I96C MscL channel activity elicited by applying negative pressure to the patch (in mmHg, below the traces). Under reducing conditions DTT (upper trace) channel activity could be observed with most openings reaching a single conductive state (o). After washing the DTT from the bath and adding peroxide (lower trace) the channels could still be activated but they stabilized in a sub-conductive state (s). ( D ) Amplitude histogram of traces from I3C/I96C patches under reducing (DTT red line) or oxidizing (peroxide blue line) conditions. Note that in the presence of peroxide a sub-conductive state is stabilized. Finally, to better understand the interactions occurring between S1 and TM2ci domains, an additional number of double mutants were analyzed by patch clamp and the results are shown in Figure 5 . Mutants I3C/K97C, I3C/N100C and E6C/K101C showed, like I3C/I96C, stabilization in a sub-conductive state upon oxidation, but did not lock closed. The mutants M12C/R104C, M12C/N100C, E9C/K101C and E6C/I96C, similar to M12C/N103C, locked closed under oxidation; however, more substates were observed for mutants in the middle of the two regions and sensitivity to oxidation varied among mutants. Open in a new tab Figure 5. Correlation between multimer peaks and channel activity of MscL double mutants under different redox potentials. In a simplified version of the 3D graph shown in Figure 2 , the multimer peaks for seven additional mutants are highlighted with red (mutants that lock close upon oxidation) or green (do not lock close upon oxidation). The inserts show the corresponding position in M. tuberculosis model of the substituted residues in E. coli MscL. Just two subunits are shown for clarity; residues in green are in S1 and those in red in TM2 ci . For each mutant the traces show single channel activity under reducing (black) or oxidizing (blue) conditions. The number under each trace is the negative pressure applied to the patch. Scale bars on the right bottom apply to all traces.",

  "ai_summary": "This study investigates the protein-protein interactions between the S1 region and the cytoplasmic interface of TM2 in the mechanosensitive channel MscL, which plays a crucial role in bacterial osmoregulation. Using an in vivo disulfide trapping assay on 143 double-cysteine mutants of E. coli MscL, researchers mapped interactions that occur as the channel transitions from a closed to an open state. The results revealed that the S1 and TM2 ci domains interact very efficiently, requiring minimal oxidizing agent to facilitate disulfide bond formation, indicating strong coupling between these regions during gating. This work enhances our understanding of how MscL senses mechanical stimuli and opens in response to osmotic changes, providing insights into the fundamental mechanisms of mechanotransduction in cells. Such knowledge is vital for advancing space biosciences, where understanding protein behavior under altered gravitational and osmotic conditions can inform the development of life-support systems and biotechnological applications in space exploration.",
