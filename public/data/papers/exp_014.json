    "abstract": "SNAREs play an important role in the process of membrane trafficking. In the present research, we investigated subcellular localization of an uncharacterized Arabidopsis thaliana protein reported to interact with a trans -Golgi network-localized Qa-SNARE, SYNTAXIN OF PLANTS 43. Based on the similarity of its amino acid sequence to metazoan fucosyltransferases, we have named this novel protein AtGTLP ( Arabidopsis thaliana G lycosyl T ransferase- L ike P rotein) and predicted that it should be a member of yet uncharacterized family of Arabidopsis fucosyltransferases, as it shows no significant sequence similarity to fucosyltransferases previously identified in Arabidopsis. AtGTLP is a membrane-anchored protein, which exhibits a type II-like topology, with a single transmembrane helix and a globular domain in the C-terminal part of its amino acid sequence. Colocalization data we collected suggest that AtGTLP should localize mainly to Golgi apparatus, especially to certain zones of trans -Golgi. As single atgtlp−/− mutants showed no obvious difference in phenotype (primary root length and fresh mass), AtGTLP and proteins related to AtGTLP with high similarity in amino acid sequences may have redundant functions. Keywords: glycosylation, Golgi apparatus, membrane trafficking, trans -Golgi network",
    "methods": "Plant material and growth conditions For colocalization observations, Arabidopsis plants were grown in growth chamber, in 22°C in long-day light (16 h/8 h, L/D) conditions on MS medium w/vitamins (Duchefa Biochemie), containing 0.3% gellan gum (Wako) and 2% sucrose. pH was adjusted to 6.265. Fluorescence was observed in cells in the elongation zone of roots of 5-day-old seedlings. For analysis of mutant phenotype, two T-DNA insertion lines SALK_025999 ( atgtlp-1 ) and SALK_011654 ( atgtlp-2 ) were used. Columbia-0 accession plants were used as a control. Growth conditions and medium were the same as for colocalization analysis. For statistical analysis of primary root length and fresh mass, 25 individuals (11-day-old) were used for each genotype. RNA extraction and RT-PCR RNA was extracted from 10-day-old Arabidopsis seedling with RNeasy® Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). 100 mg of fresh tissue was used for each sample. cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript™ III Reverse Transcriptase (ThermoFisher Scientific). 5 µg of the extracted RNA was added to each reaction as a template. The presence or lack of AtGTLP expression in mutant lines was confirmed by PCR reaction using ExTaq polymerase (Takara). 1 µg of cDNA was used as a template. Primers used for RT-PCR are listed in Supplementary Table S1. Gene cloning A 5.1 kbp fragment of nucleotide sequence comprising of the native promoter and AtGTLP ( At2g04280 ) gene sequence flanked by 5′ and 3′ UTRs was amplified using PrimeSTAR® GXL DNA Polymerase (Takara). The amplified sequence was subsequently subcloned into a pENTR™ vector using pENTR™/D-TOPO Vector Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) for directional cloning. The vector was used to transform One Shot™ TOP10 Chemically Competent Escherichia coli (ThermoFisher Scientific). Transformants were selected on solid LB medium with kanamycin 50 mg l −1 and cultured overnight in liquid LB with the same antibiotic concentration. Isolated plasmid was linearized and fused with monomeric GFP (mGFP) ( Segami et al. 2014 ) gene sequence using In-Fusion HD Kit (Takara). Product of this reaction was used to transform competent E. coli cells and the transformants selection procedure was repeated. Isolated plasmid was used as the entry clone for pHGW vector ( Karimi et al. 2002 ) as the destination vector in Gateway™ LR Clonase™ II reaction (ThermoFisher Scientific). AtGTLP-mGFP in pHGW construct was transformed into competent E. coli cells and transformant colonies were selected on solid LB medium with 100 mg l −1 spectinomycin. For creation of mRFP-GOS12 Golgi marker line, translational fusion between mRFP ( Campbell et al. 2002 ) and GOS12 were generated by inserting cDNA encoding mRFP in front of the start codon of GOS12 genomic sequence including 1.9 kb of the 5′-flanking sequence and 1.2 kb of the 3′-flanking sequence in pENTR™ vector using In-Fusion HD Kit. The resulted mRFP-GOS12 construct was subcloned into pGWB1 by LR Clonase™ II ( Nakagawa et al. 2007 ). Primers used for gene cloning and linearization are listed in Supplementary Table S1. Generation of Arabidopsis transformants Col-0 plants were infected with Agrobacterium tumefaciens transformed with the prepared plasmid containing the AtGTLP-mGFP construct using flower dip method ( Clough and Bent 1998 ). Collected seeds were sown on MS medium with 2% sucrose, 0.8% agar with 25 mg l −1 of hygromycin and 250 mg l −1 of claforan. Selection of T 1 lines with a single AtGTLP-mGFP construct was conducted by sowing T 2 seeds on selective MS medium with hygromycin. Lines, for which we observed 3 : 1 segregation ratio of resistant to non-resistant plants, were selected as single-insertion lines. Confocal laser scanning microscopy observations For subcellular localization observations of AtGTLP protein, AtGTLP-mGFP single-insertion lines were cross-pollinated with organelle markers lines. mRFP-VAMP721 ( Uemura et al. 2019 ) and tagRFP-VAMP727 ( Ebine et al. 2008 ) lines were used as markers for transport vesicle from the TGN to the cell plate/plasma membrane or to the vacuole, respectively. mRFP-SYP61 ( Shimizu et al. 2021 ), mRFP-SYP43 ( Asaoka et al. 2013 ), and VHAa1-mRFP ( Dettmer et al. 2006 ) lines were used as TGN markers. ST-mRFP was used as a trans -Golgi marker ( Uemura et al. 2012 ) and mRFP-GOS12 as a Golgi marker (in this study). Colocalization observations were conducted using Zeiss LSM980 with Airyscan 2 confocal laser scanning microscope system equipped with Plan-Apochromat 63x/1.40 Oil DIC M27 immersion objective. Excitation laser wavelengths of 488 nm and 543 nm were used. Pinhole was set to 1AU. Colocalization analysis The degree of colocalization of each organelle marker with AtGTLP-mGFP was assessed by calculating Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) ( Adler and Parmryd 2010 ; Dunn et al. 2011 ). To obtain PCC values, Coloc 2 plugin for Fiji/ImageJ software ( Schindelin et al. 2012 ) was used. For each organelle marker, three 50 µm×50 µm images with 15 randomly selected regions of interest (ROIs), freehand-drawn around the observed dot-like structures, were used for analysis (45 ROIs total for each marker). Noise in the images was corrected using the ‘Smooth’ function of Fiji/ImageJ. Line fluorescence intensity plots were generated using RGB profiler plugin for Fiji/ImageJ.",
    "results": "AtGTLP is a putative glycosyltransferase AtGTLP is predicted to be a membrane-anchored protein comprising of 568 residues. DeepTMHMM ( Hallgren et al. 2022 ; https://dtu.biolib.com/DeepTMHMM, accessed Nov 1, 2023) transmembrane topology prediction model for this protein indicates a presence of a single transmembrane helix near the N-terminus of AtGTLP protein (residues 24–44). The short N-terminal tail of the protein was predicted to localize on the cytosolic side of an organelle membrane, while residues 45–568 reside inside the lumen ( Figure 1A ). AlphaFold2 ( Jumper et al. 2021 ) model of AtGTLP’s three-dimensional structure includes a globular domain of unknown function in the C-terminal part of the amino acid sequence ( Figure 1B ). The C-terminal part of the amino-acid sequence was modelled with high confidence, while N-terminal part had a lower reliability score ( Figure 1C–E ). Figure 1. (A) Schematic model of AtGTLP topology and (B) AlphaFold2 prediction of the three-dimensional structure of AtGTLP. AtGTLP comprises of a short N-terminal tail, single transmembrane helix and globular domain in the C-terminal part of amino-acid sequence positioned on a short stalk (type II topology). (C) The prediction reliability described by predicted Local Distance Difference Test (pLDDT). Some of the regions in the N-terminal side have score less than 50 and the structures of those regions are less reliable. (D) Predicted three-dimensional structure of AtGTLP in pLDDT coloring. An α-helix at the bottom is the N-terminal side. Blue color indicates less reliable region and red color indicates region with high reliability. Note that the region with similar structure to O -fucosyltransferase 2 has high reliability. (E) Predicted Alignment Error (PAE). N-terminal side has high error (red), and C-terminal side has low error (blue). (F) Superposition between the three-dimensional structure of AtGTLP (from 260 to 566) and that of human protein O -fucosyltransferase 2 (PDB ID: 4AP6, A chain). The region in white in AtGTLP is the N-terminal region that was not included in the superposition. The gradation coloring scheme was employed from N-terminal to C-terminal side on the superposed region. Human O -fucosyltransferase 2 is colored in gray with GDP analogue in ball-and-stick model which suggests the active site of the protein. Root mean square deviation (RMSD) of the backbone is 5.9 Å. The similarity of the location of α-helices can be noticed. Open in a new tab Analysis of AtGTLP’s amino acid sequence using Phyre 2 server ( Kelley et al. 2015 ; http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/phyre2/html/page.cgi?id=index, accessed Nov 1, 2023) suggests a distant homology between the C-terminal domain of AtGTLP and human protein O -fucosyltransferase 2 (POFUT2; 19% of sequence identity, 99.2% confidence), protein O -fucosyltransferase 1 (POFUT1; 16% i.d., 98.9% confidence), as well as C. elegans protein O -fucosyltransferase 2 (CePOFUT2; 20% i.d., 98.9% confidence) and protein O -fucosyltransferase 1 (CePOFUT1; 18% i.d., 99.2% confidence). Superposition between AlphaFold2 model of C-terminal domain of AtGTLP and the top ranked template (human POFUT2; PDB ID: 4AP6, A chain) is shown in Figure 1F . Interestingly, among top ranked templates, we observed no plant GTs nor other types of plant enzymes. Moreover, although the Conserved Domain Database ( Lu et al. 2020 ; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi, accessed Nov 1, 2023) recognizes the presence of ‘ O -FUT-like’ domain in the C-terminal region of AtGTLP, when its amino acid sequence was used as a query in BLAST search against Arabidopsis proteome, none of the 38 proteins that have been characterized as members of Arabidopsis FUT family in literature ( Smith et al. 2018 ) were present among the results. No other motif that could suggest possible functions of AtGTLP has been found to be present in its amino acid sequence. In the CAZy database, AtGTLP is currently classified as ‘GTnc’. AtGTLP is localized mainly on the trans -Golgi To investigate the subcellular localization of AtGTLP, we established transgenic Arabidopsis expressing mGFP-tagged AtGTLP (AtGTLP-mGFP) under the control of native promoter. The fluorescence of AtGTLP-mGFP protein concentrated in dot- or ring-like structures scattered within the cell ( Figure 2 ). Figure 2. Subcellular localization of AtGTLP.

Scale bar=10 μm. White arrow heads in (F) close up-dots of ‘free’ tagRFP-VAMP727. Close-up scale bar=2 μm. Open in a new tab In order to reveal which organelle those structures correspond to, we established double-visualization Arabidopsis lines expressing AtGTLP-mGFP with various RFP-tagged organelle markers. Among tested markers, the extent of colocalization of AtGTLP with trans -Golgi marker, ST ( Boevink et al. 1998 ) was the highest and relatively consistent among all analyzed ROIs ( Figure 3 ; PCC=0.5–0.91; median=0.75), suggesting that a significant population of AtGTLP localizes to trans -Golgi. Visual observations of colocalization of these two proteins show that while both seem to often localize to the same disk-like structures, patches of magenta-only and green-only fluorescence within those structures were also visible ( Figure 2A , ‘close-up’). Based on this characteristic, we suspect that within trans -Golgi, AtGTLP segregates to specific zones only. As expected, relatively high PCCs were obtained also when colocalization with GOS12, a Golgi marker ( Figure 2B ; Uemura et al. 2004 ), was analyzed ( Figure 3 ; 0.21–0.83, median=0.58). However, whereas for the AtGTLP-mGFP/ST-mRFP pair, the two peaks representing GFP and RFP in side-view line fluorescence profile of a single disk-like structure overlap almost entirely ( Figure 4A ), for the AtGTLP-mGFP/mRFP-GOS12 pair a slight shift between those two peaks was observed ( Figure 4B ). Figure 3. Colocalization of AtGTLP with organelle markers. As a mean of assessing the degree of colocalization, for each marker line expressing AtGTLP-mGFP and organelle marker fused with RFP Pearson’s correlation coefficient was calculated for 45 ROIs hand-drawn around clusters of dot-like structures. Three separate images were analyzed (15 ROIs/image) for each marker. Median is shown for each marker. Open in a new tab Figure 4.

(A)–(G) left panel—en face orientation of AtGTLP ring; right panel—side orientation of AtGTLP ring. Intensity plot was generated along and in direction of the white arrow. Scale bar=1 μm. Open in a new tab Moreover, we found that in some of the analyzed ROIs, AtGTLP partially colocalizes with TGN markers, SYP61 ( Figure 2C ; Uemura et al. 2004 ) and VHAa1 ( Figure 2D ; Dettmer et al. 2006 ), whereas in other ROIs, PCC was close to zero ( Figure 3 ; PCC=0.0–0.65; median=0.41 and PCC=−0.01–0.79; median=0.46, respectively). Side-view line fluorescence profiles for these two markers show a similar shift between the GFP and RFP peaks ( Figure 4C, D ). Interestingly, for the third analyzed TGN marker used in this study, SYP43 ( Uemura et al. 2004 ), we observed that areas where the two colors of florescence overlap with each other, were scarcer ( Figure 2E ). Relatively low degree of colocalization for AtGTLP-mGFP/mRFP-SYP43 pair was also reflected in lower PCC values ( Figure 3 ; −0.17–0.64, with median of 0.26) and line fluorescence profile, which suggest that SYP43 localizes to the center of AtGTLP rings ( Figure 4E ). Taking into consideration the possibility that AtGTLP is transported within the cell as a cargo, two transport pathway markers—VAMP721, a marker of transport from the TGN to the cell plate and the plasma membrane, as well as VAMP727, a marker of vacuolar transport ( Shimizu and Uemura 2022 )—were also included in the study. In case of VAMP721, we observed very little overlap of GFP and RFP fluorescence ( Figure 2F , Figure 4F ), and low PCCs ( Figure 3 ; −0.48–0.48, median=0.15), whereas colocalization between AtGTLP and VAMP727, similarly to SYP61 and VHAa1, was inconsistent across the analyzed ROIs ( Figure 2G , Figure 3 ; PCC=0.01–0.7, median=0.42). Line fluorescence profiles for AtGTLP-GFP/tagRFP-VAMP727 pair also show a pattern similar to AtGTLP-GFP/mRFP-SYP61 pair ( Figure 4G ). When inspecting the degree of colocalization visually, we observed that the areas of overlapping fluorescence were present mainly within clusters of dot- or ring-like structures, which most likely correspond to Golgi/TGN. In addition to these clusters, ‘free’ dots of tagRFP-VAMP727 signal, where AtGTLP-mGFP was absent, could also be observed ( Figure 2G , arrowheads). atgtlp mutants exhibit no obvious phenotypes According to data available in eFP Browser (Klepikova Arabidopsis Atlas; Klepikova et al. 2016 ), AtGTLP is expressed in most parts of a plant, including roots and young leaves, with the exception of dry seeds. In both mutant lines used in this study, T-DNA insertion was confirmed to be present inside AtGTLP ’s exon ( Figure 5A ). Although the results of RT-PCR confirmed that transcription of AtGTLP in both of the T-DNA lines is absent or reduced to levels undetectable with this method ( Figure 5B ), growth of mutant plants was comparable to wild type plants, and we could not observe any distinctive phenotype differences between atgtlp-1 or atgtlp-2 single mutants and wild-type plants in 8-day-old and 11-day-old seedlings ( Figure 5C, D ).
